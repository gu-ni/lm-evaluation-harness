    "question": "Tina is a diligent high school student who juggles her studies with a part-time job at the local café. Every afternoon, she clocks in and earns a steady wage of eighteen dollars for each hour she works. Alongside her classes, this job helps her save up for college and other small joys in life.\n\nThere’s a special rule at the café that rewards hardworking employees: if Tina’s shift lasts longer than eight hours, the extra time she spends working is considered overtime. This overtime isn't paid at the regular rate; instead, she earns her usual hourly wage plus half of that amount for these extra hours. This means that every hour beyond the eight-hour mark brings in more money than her standard pay.\n\nFor one entire week, Tina works ten hours a day, five days straight. Each day, she carefully notes down the hours she puts in, mindful of how many of them qualify for that extra overtime pay. The café’s payment system ensures she receives exactly what she deserves based on her time and effort.\n\nNow, Tina wonders just how much all this hard work adds up to by the end of the week. With the understanding of the regular hourly pay, the overtime pay, the ten-hour workdays, and the five days in total, she tries to figure out her total earnings.\n\nHow much money will Tina bring home after working ten hours a day for those five busy days?",
    "answer": "She works 8 hours a day for $18 per hour so she makes 8*18 = $<<8*18=144.00>>144.00 per 8-hour shift\nShe works 10 hours a day and anything over 8 hours is eligible for overtime, so she gets 10-8 = <<10-8=2>>2 hours of overtime\nOvertime is calculated as time and a half so and she makes $18/hour so her overtime pay is 18*.5 = $<<18*.5=9.00>>9.00\nHer overtime pay is 18+9 = $<<18+9=27.00>>27.00\nHer base pay is $144.00 per 8-hour shift and she works 5 days and makes 5 * $144 = $<<144*5=720.00>>720.00\nHer overtime pay is $27.00 per hour and she works 2 hours of overtime per day and makes 27*2 = $<<27*2=54.00>>54.00 in overtime pay\n2 hours of overtime pay for 5 days means she makes 54*5 = $270.00\nIn 5 days her base pay is $720.00 and she makes $270.00 in overtime pay so she makes $720 + $270 = $<<720+270=990.00>>990.00\n#### 990",

    "question": "**Post-Apocalyptic Survival Log**\n\nIn the remnants of the old world, where entertainment is scarce and joy is a precious commodity, the settlement of New Haven just announced a rare event—a traveling band performing under the wounded sky. Tickets for this concert, a beacon of hope amid the ruins, are traded at 40 credits each, a considerable sum earned through barter and toil.\n\nMr. Benson, a seasoned survivor known for his resourcefulness, decided to gather enough tickets not just for himself but for his small community. He acquired twelve of these coveted passes. In an effort to encourage solidarity and generosity among survivors, the ticket barons offer a discount: for every ticket purchased beyond the tenth one, buyers receive a five percent reduction in the ticket’s price, as a reward for fostering collective morale.\n\nThus, Mr. Benson’s purchase involved a straightforward but vital calculation within the harsh economy of New Haven. The first ten tickets carried the full weight of 40 credits each, while the two additional tickets slipped under the mercy of the discount—each costing less by that five percent margin. This tiered pricing system embodies the barter economy’s subtle complexities, balancing incentive and fairness among the dwindling population.\n\nFaced with this structure, Mr. Benson must now tally the total cost of his purchase so he can negotiate the final transfer of credits with the ticket barons, ensuring that no extra burdens fall upon his group’s fragile resources. Every credit spent must be justified in the ledger of survival.\n\nGiven these conditions—the full price for ten tickets and a five percent discount applied to the two tickets beyond that—what is the total amount of credits Mr. Benson has to transfer to claim all twelve concert passes?",
    "answer": "Mr. Benson had a 5% discount for each of the 12 - 10 = <<12-10=2>>2 tickets.\nSo, those two tickets had a $40 x 5/100 = $<<40*5/100=2>>2 discount each.\nHence, each ticket cost $40 - $2 = $<<40-2=38>>38 each.\nThus, two discounted tickets amount to $38 x 2 = $<<38*2=76>>76.\nAnd the other ten tickets amount to $40 x 10 = $<<40*10=400>>400.\nHence, Mr. Benson paid a total of $400 + $76 = $<<400+76=476>>476.\n#### 476",

    "question": "Under the cover of midnight in a sprawling industrial complex, two operatives known only as Stella and Twinkle had been assigned an urgent and critical mission: to transport a vast shipment of stone blocks to a secret location. The truck parked in the loading bay could carry precisely 6000 of these heavy blocks, a quantifiable limit that neither could risk exceeding. Every stone placed meant more progress—and a tighter deadline closing in.\n\nBoth agents were experts in logistics and speed, each capable of handling a relentless pace, loading stone blocks with a steady rhythm of 250 blocks every hour, working in perfect synchrony. For the first four hours, Stella and Twinkle moved alone, their efforts alone setting the tempo, racing against the emerging dawn as the truck slowly filled with their haul.\n\nJust as shadows began to stretch, six additional skilled workers—each matching Stella and Twinkle's efficiency—arrived under strict confidentiality. Their combined force dramatically shifted the tempo at which the stones moved. Now, with eight people loading simultaneously at a shared rate of 250 blocks per hour every individual, the truck’s fill rate accelerated sharply. Every minute counted, and the team was pressed to meet the clandestine deadline before the shipment’s destination became compromised.\n\nThe question that haunted the operation’s leader was clear and pressing: accounting for the initial four hours of labor by Stella and Twinkle alone, and then the intensified effort with eight workers loading at the same individual rate, what was the total duration required to completely fill the truck to its exact capacity of 6000 stone blocks?\n\nTime was running out, and precision was paramount—how many hours in total did this entire loading operation last, from the very first stone to the final block loaded aboard?",
    "answer": "Stella and Twinkle filled up the truck at the rate of 250 blocks per hour per person, a total of 2*250 = <<250*2=500>>500 blocks per hour for both.\nAfter working for four hours, Stella and Twinkle had filled 4*500 = <<4*500=2000>>2000 blocks into the truck.\nThe number of blocks they had to put into the truck for it to be full is 6000-2000 = <<6000-2000=4000>>4000\nWhen 6 more people joined Stella and Twinkle, a total of 2+6 = <<2+6=8>>8 people were filling the truck now.\nWorking at the rate of 250 blocks per person, the eight people filled the truck with 250*8 = <<250*8=2000>>2000 blocks in one hour.\nIf there were 4000 blocks that still needed to be put into the truck, the 8 people took 4000/2000 = <<4000/2000=2>>2 hours to fill the truck with the blocks.\nThe total time it took to fill up the tank is 4+2 = <<4+2=6>>6 hours.\n#### 6",

    "question": "In the ancient land of Eldoria, where mighty heroes often faced trials that tested not just their strength but their wisdom, there lived a young warrior named Bobby. Known far and wide for his cleverness and his cherished collection of enchanted toy chariots, Bobby was about to embark on a most peculiar quest. These toy chariots were no ordinary trinkets—they held a magical property that changed their number through the passage of time, a secret gift from the gods.\n\nOn the day of his trial, Bobby’s master revealed the first part of the puzzle: at the beginning of his journey, he possessed sixteen of these sacred toy chariots. However, the magic imbued within these chariots caused their numbers to swell by one half every year. This growth was not random but instead a steadfast rule of the divine enchantment, ensuring that the number of chariots increased by fifty percent after each cycle of the sun.\n\nBobby’s task was clear, yet challenging. He had to determine how many chariots would be in his possession after three complete cycles under this magical rule. Each year’s growth compounded upon the previous count, weaving a tale of increase that stretched well beyond mere addition. To pass this trial, Bobby needed to see beyond the numbers and grasp the rhythm of the chariots’ mystical multiplication through time.\n\nThe sacred scrolls used in Eldoria’s libraries spoke of such problems not as mere calculations but as clues embedded in nature’s own order—the harmony between growth and time. Bobby was to decipher this harmony, using the initial count and the knowledge of annual increase to foresee the abundance of his collection three years hence.\n\nWhat, then, would be the total number of these mighty toy chariots that Bobby would marshal at the end of three years? This was the enigma he was charged to solve, a test of his foresight and understanding of the divine proportions guiding his treasure.",
    "answer": "In the first year, Bobby will acquire 16 * .5 = <<16*.5=8>>8 new cars.\nAfter the first year, he will have a total of 16 + 8 = <<16+8=24>>24 cars.\nIn the second year, Bobby will acquire 24 * .5 = <<24*.5=12>>12 new cars.\nAfter the second year, he will have 24 + 12 = <<24+12=36>>36 cars in total.\nIn the third year, Bobby will acquire 36 * .5 = <<36*.5=18>>18 new cars.\nAfter the third year, he will have 36 + 18 = <<36+18=54>>54 cars in total.\n#### 54",

Among the citizens is Bella and Bob, a duo whose journey through time has been carefully logged by the Temporal Anniversaries Registry.\n\nThe regulation states that in precisely six months from the current temporal timestamp, Bella and Bob will commemorate their fourth anniversary—a notable event marking four full years since their union was officially acknowledged across timelines. These cycles are measured in months for accuracy, and celebrations are enforced to occur exactly on these monthly milestones without deviation.\n\nTimekeepers in Chronora are tasked with ensuring that past celebrations, such as the second anniversary, are correctly placed on the continuum, maintaining an accurate history to avoid any paradoxes or disruptions. The records prompt an inquiry: at what point in the past—measured in months prior to the present moment—did Bella and Bob honor their second anniversary? This is vital for confirming the integrity of their personal timekeeping.\n\nGiven the scheduled fourth anniversary in six months from now, the question arises: how many months ago were they celebrating their second? Calculating this ensures compliance with the Temporal Regulation Protocol, preserving the chronological order of significant events.\n\nUnderstanding this interval is crucial for time auditors who must verify all events align coherently within the framework of personal timelines.

    "question": "In the boundless realm of dreamscapes, Ravi acts as a master architect, crafting worlds from fragments of shimmering light and whispers of thought. Within one such lucid vision, he found himself collecting luminous coins—elements of energy that shape the flow and order of his creations. These coins come in three distinct types: the soft blue nickels that hum with steady pulse, the radiant silver quarters that flicker like moonbeams, and the gentle gold dimes that glow like sunrises.\n\nIn this dream domain, Ravi noticed a subtle harmony: the number of quarters always exceeds the nickels by exactly two, as if the moonlight quarters guarded the steadfast nickels. Further, the dimes outnumber the quarters by precisely four, their golden light adding a brighter dimension to the collection—all balanced delicately in this crafted illusion. On this occasion, he found himself holding exactly six nickels, each contributing a steady rhythm to the dream’s undercurrent.\n\nTasked with weaving an understanding of his treasure, Ravi contemplated the total worth of these coins—how their combined luminescence would influence the patterns in his dream worlds. The precise counts thus defined the boundaries of this magnitude: six nickels, two more quarters than those nickels, and four additional dimes beyond the quarters. Each type of coin had its own intrinsic value within the dream’s economy, guiding Ravi’s assessment.\n\nTo fully grasp the extent of his energy, Ravi needed to combine both the counts and the values of these coins, carefully adding their worth to comprehend the total reservoir that would fuel his architectural designs. This synthesis required a clear calculation, respecting the relationships among his coins as the fabric of his dream depended on exactness.\n\nWhat, then, is the grand total of energy in Ravi’s collection when he counts six nickels, with the quarters and dimes arranged just so, molded by these numeric connections?",
    "answer": "Ravi has 6 + 2 = <<6+2=8>>8 quarters.\nHe has also 8 + 4 = <<8+4=12>>12 dimes.\nA nickel is worth 5 cents so Ravi's nickels amount to 6 x 5 = <<6*5=30>>30 cents.\nA quarter is worth 25 cents so his quarters amount to 8 x 25 = <<8*25=200>>200 cents.\nA dime is worth 10 cents so his dimes amount to 12 x 10 = <<12*10=120>>120 cents.\ntherefore, Ravi has 30 + 200 + 120 = <<30+200+120=350>>350 cents.\n#### 350",

    "question": "**Urban Legend Investigator Log: Entry #47**\n\nIn the heart of the city, amidst the bustling markets rumored to harbor hidden secrets, lies the curious tale of the Fruit Merchant’s Enigma. According to whispered legends, this merchant’s pricing held a peculiar balance that puzzled even the savviest shoppers. It was said that the price of a single watermelon was mysteriously equal to the price of exactly four apples combined—a curious pricing charm that caught many off guard.\n\nLate last week, an intrepid customer ventured into the market, guided by these rumors. They purchased a total of thirty-six fruits, choosing them with care so that the count of oranges, apples, and watermelons was perfectly balanced. This meant that each type of fruit made up exactly one-third of their entire haul, a harmonious blend that felt almost ritualistic in its symmetry. The price of a single orange was known by street vendors everywhere—precisely fifty cents, a fixed rate that never changed.\n\nThis shopper’s final bill came to an astonishing sixty-six dollars, a figure that many deemed too precise to be luck. The challenge now is to uncover the secret behind this total, a puzzle whispered about in the marketplace’s shadowed corners. By piecing together the relationships—the equal value of four apples to one watermelon, the even split of thirty-six fruits among the three types, and the fixed price of oranges—the hidden cost of a single apple remains the keystone to unlocking the mystery.\n\nWith the city’s echoes of bartering and bargaining as the backdrop, this investigation calls for sharp reasoning and careful calculation. The goal is to determine the price of one apple, the value that fits seamlessly into this delicate arithmetic puzzle born in the urban wilds.\n\nWhat price must be assigned to the apple to satisfy the ancient yet strangely logical market lore?",
    "answer": "If 36 fruits were evenly split between 3 types of fruits, then I bought 36/3 = <<36/3=12>>12 units of each fruit\nIf 1 orange costs $0.50 then 12 oranges will cost $0.50 * 12 = $<<0.5*12=6>>6\nIf my total bill was $66 and I spent $6 on oranges then I spent $66 - $6 = $<<66-6=60>>60 on the other 2 fruit types.\nAssuming the price of watermelon is W, and knowing that you can buy 4 apples for the same price and that the price of one apple is A, then 1W=4A\nIf we know we bought 12 watermelons and 12 apples for $60, then we know that $60 = 12W + 12A\nKnowing that 1W=4A, then we can convert the above to $60 = 12(4A) + 12A\n$60 = 48A + 12A\n$60 = <<60=60>>60A\nThen we know the price of one apple (A) is $60/60= $<<60/60=1>>1\n#### 1",

The prosecution and defense are locked in a battle to present the establishment’s true earnings to determine its rightful tax obligations. The courtroom listens intently as the clubby accountant steps forward to explain the restaurant's weekly income patterns.\n\nThe accountant testifies that on every weekday, the restaurant’s daily earnings amount to exactly six hundred dollars. However, the weekend days tell a different story—each of those days brings in double the amount made on the weekdays, reflecting the crowded tables and joyous celebrations that are typical when the city unwinds from its bustling workweek. The month in question varies in length but follows the regular calendar structure, with the specific number of weekdays and weekend days forming the foundation of this financial examination.\n\nThe judge sharpens their focus as the accountant continues, clarifying that the goal is to determine the restaurant's total earnings by the very end of the month. This encompasses summing all the straightforward weekday incomes alongside the boosted weekend receipts. The evidence must faithfully represent every dollar earned, leaving no ambiguity for financial judgment or future business considerations.\n\nAs the jury contemplates the details, each member must reason carefully, weighing how the daily revenue rates multiplied by the number of corresponding days come together to reveal the full picture.

This trial was not won by might but by keen wit and the ability to unravel the secrets held within their treasure tokens—enchanted coins bearing the marks of different values.\n\nOliver, the first challenger, carried within his leather pouch a bundle of ten gleaming gold pieces, each worth twenty chimes, beside three smaller, fiver runestones, warm with a gentle amber glow. These tokens were said to hold power not just in their numbers but in the weight of their worth, each gold piece far outweighing the smaller fives in value.\n\nWilliam, his worthy rival, bore a different set of enchanted coins: fifteen bright silver pieces, each marked to represent ten chimes, alongside a handful of four smaller five-chime runes, shimmering faintly like droplets of morning dew. The mystical values embedded in these stones were crucial, for the trial would judge who bore the greater bounty of wealth.\n\nThe ancient rules of the trial decreed that understanding the total value carried by each challenger was paramount, evaluating not the quantity of each type of coin but the sum they represented in the magical currency of Eldoria.

She recently hired six crew members to maintain and manage the essential warehouse operations critical for the colony’s survival. These six individuals are divided into two roles: four are skilled warehouse technicians responsible for transporting and sorting cargo, while two are sharp-minded supervisors who coordinate the workflow and handle administrative duties.\n\nThe colony’s compensation system is straightforward yet stringent: each warehouse technician receives 15 space credits per hour for their labor, a rate reflecting the demanding physical intensity of their role. Meanwhile, managers earn a slightly higher wage of 20 space credits per hour to match their responsibilities in overseeing operations. The colony’s labor cycles require all workers to be on duty for 25 days every standard month, with each shift lasting 8 hours, ensuring that the supply lines remain uninterrupted.\n\nIn addition to wages, the colony’s governance imposes a mandatory tax on all workers’ earnings known as the Federation Income Contribution Allocation—FICA tax for short. This tax amounts to 10% of the total salaries paid, underscoring the colony’s commitment to public funding and collective welfare. Janet, as the employer, is responsible for paying this tax alongside the wages, integrating it into her monthly payroll expenses.\n\nWith the regular hours and days set, Janet now needs to determine the full financial commitment required to compensate the entire workforce. She must calculate the combined amount of the base wages for all six employees and the extra levy imposed by the FICA taxes, reflecting the total cost of running her team for an entire month.\n\nThe challenge that lies before Janet is to figure out the total amount she owes in space credits when including both the workers' salaries and the necessary tax payments, covering 25 working days at 8 hours per day for everyone on her staff. How much will Janet need to budget to fulfill her obligations to her crew and the colony’s tax authorities for that month?",
    "answer": "First figure out how many hours each worker works per month by multiplying the number of days they work by the number of hours a day they work: 25 days * 8 hours/day = <<25*8=200>>200 hours\nThen calculate how much one warehouse worker makes per month by multiplying their hourly rate by the number of hours they work: 200 hours * $15/hour = $<<200*15=3000>>3000\nThen multiply that number by 4 to find out how much all the warehouse workers make: $3000/worker * 4 workers = $<<3000*4=12000>>12,000\nNow multiply the hours each manager works (also 200) by their hourly wage to find out how much one manager makes per month: 200 hours * $20/hour = $<<200*20=4000>>4,000\nNow multiply one manager's wages by the number of managers (2) to find their total wage amount: $4,000/manager * 2 managers = $<<4000*2=8000>>8,000\nNow add the wages for the managers and the workers to find the total cost of the wages: $8,000 + $12,000 = $<<8000+12000=20000>>20,000\nNow multiply the total wage bill by 10% to find how much the FICA taxes are: $20,000 * .1 = $<<20000*.1=2000>>2,000\nNow add the total wage bill to the total tax amount to find the grand total: $2,000 + $20,000 = $<<2000+20000=22000>>22,000\n#### 22000",

It tells of Bella, a scholar of rare collections, who meticulously treasures three precious relics: shimmering marbles, gliding frisbees, and ornate deck cards.\n\nWithin the archive’s world, the balance of Bella’s treasures follows strict decree. It is known that the count of her marbles is exactly twice that of her frisbees, forming a harmonious double ratio revered among collectors. Moreover, the number of frisbees she possesses surpasses the trove of deck cards by precisely twenty, a gap that marks her unique signature collection style. At present, the stone reveals that Bella’s marbles total sixty, a figure that anchors the count of other relics by sacred proportion.\n\nThe Puzzlekeeper’s ancient script further unfolds a twist: Bella plans to acquire two-fifths more of each kind of item — marbles, frisbees, and deck cards alike — as if the scrolls’ magic stretches her current stash by exactly the same fractional increase. This acquisition promises a new total for each relic, swelling her collection according to this measured growth.\n\nThe task set before seekers of wisdom is to ascertain the full sum of Bella’s treasures after this planned expansion — to deduce how many marbles, frisbees, and deck cards she will hold when her purchases manifest into reality. This calculation must honor the double relationship between marbles and frisbees, the precise surplus of frisbees over cards, and the fractional increase in each item’s quantity. \n\nThus, the ancient scrolls ask: once Bella acquires these additional relics, what will the grand total number of all her items be, counted together in the glow of the Archive’s eternal light?",
    "answer": "When Bella buys 2/5 times more marbles, she'll have increased the number of marbles by 2/5*60 = <<2/5*60=24>>24\nThe total number of marbles she'll have is 60+24 = <<60+24=84>>84\nIf Bella currently has 60 marbles, and she has two times as many marbles as frisbees, she has 60/2 = <<60/2=30>>30 frisbees.\nIf Bella buys 2/5 times more frisbees, she'll have 2/5*30 = <<2/5*30=12>>12 more frisbees.\nThe total number of frisbees she'll have will increase to 30+12 = <<30+12=42>>42\nBella also has 20 more frisbees than deck cards, meaning she has 30-20 = <<20-10=10>>10 deck cards\nIf she buys 2/5 times more deck cards, she'll have 2/5*10 = <<2/5*10=4>>4 more deck cards.\nThe total number of deck cards she'll have is 10+4 = <<10+4=14>>14\nTogether, Bella will have a total of 14+42+84 = <<14+42+84=140>>140 items\n#### 140",

    "question": "**Genetic Algorithm Lab Notes: Snake Length Optimization**\n\nIn our latest field experiment, researchers Jake and Penny have embarked on a quest to study the growth patterns of snakes in controlled environments. Each has captured a snake whose length is crucial data for analyzing genetic traits influencing size variance. These lengths will serve as key variables in our next iteration of the breeding algorithm.\n\nAccording to observations, Jake’s snake exceeds Penny’s by a consistent margin of 12 inches. When combining their lengths, the total measured value reaches exactly 70 inches. This relationship represents an essential constraint in our algorithm’s fitness function, reflecting the balance between genetic factors contributing to each snake’s development.\n\nThe goal within this experimental setup is to precisely determine the length of Jake’s snake, based on both the incremental difference and the combined total. Accurately establishing this length will enable us to calibrate the parameters of our genetic algorithm, ensuring the model mimics natural length disparities and population data.\n\nWe aim to solve this by aligning the data points so that Jake’s length and Penny’s length satisfy the condition where Jake’s snake surpasses Penny’s by the predefined 12 inches, while their total remains constrained by the 70-inch boundary. This forms the core calculation challenge driving our genetic model refinement.\n\nWhat is the exact length of Jake’s snake within these constraints, so that the snake lengths conform perfectly to the experimental conditions and inform our next optimization cycle?",
    "answer": "Let j be the length of Jake's snake and p be length of Penny's snake. We know that j + p = 70, and j = p + 12.\nWe can substitute the second equation into the first equation to get p + 12 + p = 70\nCombining like terms, we get 2p + 12 = 70\nSubtracting 12 from both sides, we get 2p = 58\nDividing both sides by 2, we get p = 58 / 2 = <<58/2=29>>29 inches. Penny's snake is 29 inches.\nSubstituting that length in to the equation j = p + 12, we get j = 29 inches + 12 inches = <<29+12=41>>41 inches\n#### 41",

    "question": "In the heart of a vast and ancient battlefield, a seasoned quartermaster was charged with marking out a strategic encampment area for the army. This encampment needed to be a large rectangular plot of land, spacious enough to hold all the troops and their supplies, yet confined within strict boundaries to optimize defense and mobility.\n\nAccording to the guidelines passed down by the commanders, the length of the encampment had to maintain a specific proportion to the width. For every one unit of width, the length was to be exactly four times greater. This rule was rooted in ancient tactical wisdom, ensuring the camp’s shape supported both the placement of ranks and the flow of communication.\n\nThe quartermaster was also tasked with ensuring the total area of the encampment measured precisely one hundred square meters. This precise measurement was crucial; if the area were too large, the army would be stretched thin, and if too small, it could not accommodate the entire contingent effectively.\n\nKnowing these constraints, the quartermaster sought to determine the exact length of this rectangular plot. This knowledge would allow the commanders to deploy their forces with both pride and precision, maintaining the balance between size and shape dictated by their seasoned traditions.\n\nGiven the area’s requirement and the strict length-to-width ratio, the quartermaster pondered: what would be the length of this important battlefield rectangle?",

    "question": "In the bustling heart of the enchanted kingdom, there stood a quaint inn renowned for its timeless charm and whispered stories of old. Among its many guests were two brothers, Yuan and David, travelers whose ages often sparked the curiosity of the innfolk. The innkeeper, a wise old mage, took it upon himself to unravel the riddle of their years, weaving the tale into the inn’s age-old ledger.\n\nAccording to the innkeeper’s records, Yuan’s age shone like a beacon brighter than David’s, for he was seven years senior to his brother. Yet, these were no ordinary years—there was a deeper, magical balance at play: Yuan’s numbers of cycles through the seasons were precisely twice those of David. This meant that for every year David had spent wandering the kingdom, Yuan had experienced the passage of two, all while being seven years ahead in age.\n\nThe ledger, worn and glowing faintly with enchantment, held the key to understanding their true ages. The innkeeper knew that by unraveling the dance of their years—the balance of seven plus the double ratio—he could reveal the hidden truth behind the brothers’ journey through time.\n\nAs metaphors danced in the air and runes shaped the invisible bonds of age, the challenge was set: to determine how many seasons David had counted in his life, given his older brother's intertwined fate. The inns’ motto whispered that knowledge of these ages would unlock a deeper understanding of their path.\n\nWith quill poised and magic humming softly, the innkeeper asked a question to all who would listen: How many years had the younger brother, David, lived according to the tale inscribed in the enchanted ledger?",
    "answer": "Let x be David's age. Yuan is seven years older than David, 7 + x = Y years.\nYuan is also twice David's age, 2 * x = Y years.\nSince these two equations equal the same thing, we can write: 7 + x = 2 * x.\nSubtracting x from both sides we get 7 = x, so David is 7 years old.\n#### 7",

Ryan, a rising statesman known for his charismatic rallies, was organizing a grand feast to showcase his growing influence. Meanwhile, Taylor, his rival, planned a more modest birthday gathering to strengthen local bonds and celebrate their circle of loyal supporters.\n\nWithin the intricate web of Eldorian politics, the size of a noble’s event often reflects their clout. It was observed by many in the court that Ryan’s party dwarfed Taylor’s in scale; in fact, the number of attendees at Ryan’s feast was exactly four times greater than those at Taylor’s birthday celebration. Yet, the combined total of citizens gathering at these two events was carefully recorded by the kingdom’s chroniclers to be 240 individuals, as every seat and voice in such meetings could tip the balance of power.\n\nThe court’s advisor posed a challenge to those keen on understanding the political dynamics at play: given that Ryan’s assembly had fourfold the number present at Taylor’s event, and together both gatherings held 240 people, how many loyal supporters had Ryan managed to rally under his banners?

This relic, inherited from scholars of old, was known to be a bit temperamental, behaving according to peculiar rules etched into its very gears and cogs. The printer was tasked with producing the 42-page census report, a document crucial for the kingdom’s record-keeping.\n\nThe printer had two curious quirks, well understood by the scribes of Scrolloria. Every seventh page it produced would suffer from a crumpled imperfection—crumpling that no royal decree could smooth away. Meanwhile, every third page would bear ink so blurred that the royal inspectors could scarcely read the heraldic entries inscribed upon them. Pages afflicted by both crumples and blurs created a tangled mess, while those free of defects were prized for their clarity and form.\n\nJames, keen on ensuring the report was trustworthy and presentable to the council, needed to ascertain how many pages, out of the forty-two, would emerge from the printer neither crumpled by the seventh-page flaw nor blurred by the third-page curse.

Since half the 20 skeletons are adult women, that means there are 20/2=<<20/2=10>>10 adult women's skeletons.\nThe remaining half, 10, is split between adult men and children, meaning there are 10/2= <<10/2=5>>5 of each.\nSince an adult woman has 20 bones in their body, this means that the 10 skeletons have 20*10=<<20*10=200>>200 bones in total.\nSince an adult man has 5 more bones in their body than an adult woman, this means they have 20+5= <<20+5=25>>25 bones in their body.\nThere are 5 adult men, meaning there are 25*5=<<25*5=125>>125 bones in the adult male skeletons in total.\nSince a child has half as many bones as the 20 in an adult woman, this means the children have 20/2= <<20/2=10>>10 bones in their body.\nSince there are 5 children, this means there are 5*10= <<5*10=50>>50 bones in the children's skeletons in total.\nTherefore, altogether there are 50+125+200= <<50+125+200=375>>375 bones in total in the graveyard.\n#### 375",

    "question": "In the ever-changing corridors of the Shifting Labyrinth, there dwelt a maiden named Jenny, who sought to celebrate a grand union amidst the twisting walls. This occasion would bring together a gathering of exactly eighty souls, each invited to partake in a feast befitting the occasion’s honor and mystery. Yet, the labyrinth’s nature meant that Jenny needed to prepare carefully, for no detail could be left to chance in this ever-shifting realm.\n\nAmong the multitude, whispers of preference for the feast’s offerings emerged. It was said that for every one guest who chose the tender fowl, three other guests desired the rich, savory flesh of the mighty beast known as the Steak. Such a ratio was rare but clear, as if the maze itself had dictated the tastes of those wandering its halls. The stewardship of the feast was entrusted with precise costs: to serve the hearty Steak to one guest would require twenty-five gold coins, while the delicate Chicken demanded eighteen gold coins.\n\nJenny’s puzzle was clear: she must map out the entirety of the feast’s expense, balancing the proportions of her guests’ preferences with the fixed price of each. The vital truth was that the sum of souls partaking in steak and chicken could be no less or more than the eighty honored guests. Within these bounds, she must uncover the total treasure required to satisfy her guests’ appetites and honor her vow.\n\nEvery nook of the labyrinth seemed to whisper this riddle — how many of the eighty invited sought the hearty Steak, and how many chose the lighter Chicken, given the sacred three-to-one preference? And, beyond this question of numbers, lay the deeper query of the gold coins needed to secure those meals, weaving together choice, cost, and the precise count into a single tapestry.\n\nThus, amidst the twisting paths and shifting walls, Jenny’s task stood: to reveal the total bounty of gold needed for the banquet, balancing the threefold desire for Steak against the solitary yearning for Chicken, all within the sacred total of eighty guests. The labyrinth awaited her answer, as did the feast.",
    "answer": "Let s be the number of guests who want steak and c be the number who want chicken. We know that s + c = 80 and s = 3c.\nSubstituting the second equation into the first equation, we get 3c + c = 80\nCombining like terms, we get 4c = 80\nDividing both sides by 4, we get c = 20\nThen multiply the number of guests who want chicken by the cost of each chicken entree: 20 guests * $18/guest = $<<20*18=360>>360\nThen triple the number of guests who want chicken to find the number who want steak: 20 guests * 3 = <<20*3=60>>60 guests\nThen multiply the number of guests who want steak by the cost of each steak entree: 60 guests * $25/guest = $<<60*25=1500>>1500\nThen add the cost of the steak and chicken entrees to find the total cost: $1500 + $360 = $<<1500+360=1860>>1860\n#### 1860",

    "question": "In a distant corner of the Space-Time Puzzle Labyrinth, two explorers named Mario and Maria navigated the twisting corridors where ages and moments bend like light through a prism. In this realm, the passage of time follows peculiar laws, and understanding one’s age requires unraveling the subtle relationships woven into the fabric of these corridors.\n\nAt this crossroads of time, Mario and Maria’s ages collectively form a unique key. Their combined years add up to exactly seven—a number that glows with significance under the shifting chronosphere. The labyrinth’s whispered rules reveal an intimate truth: Mario’s age exceeds Maria’s by precisely one year, a small yet crucial difference that marks their positions along the timeline.\n\nTo unlock the pathway forward, one must determine the exact number of years that Mario carries on this journey. His age is not a mere floating number; it is bound to Maria’s age by the labyrinth’s temporal code, requiring careful thought to separate the entwined ages from their shared sum.\n\nWithin this enigma, the explorers’ present ages hold the secret to passage. The realm demands a solution that respects both the total of seven years and the singular age difference between the siblings. Only by deciphering Mario’s age can the pair continue their voyage through the endless loops of time and maze-like mysteries.\n\nWhat is the number of years that Mario possesses in this riddle of time, given the sum of their ages and the age gap they share?",
    "answer": "If x is Maria's age, then Mario's age is x + 1.\nThe equation that represents the sum of their ages is x + x + 1 = 7.\nBy combining like terms, the equation becomes 2x = 6.\nHence, the value of x which represents the age of Maria is 6/2=<<6/2=3>>3.\nSo Mariu is 3 + 1 = <<3+1=4>>4 years old.\n#### 4",

    "question": "In a forgotten temple deep within the jungle, the ancient civilization of Numera held sacred ceremonies known as the Number Rituals. These rituals involved offerings of metallic discs, each bearing distinct symbols and values, which the people believed balanced the harmony of their world.\n\nOne day, Harriett, a curious explorer of these old traditions, unearthed a tattered alcove where remnants of such a ritual were hidden. Amongst the dust-covered relics, she discovered exactly ten shining discs marked with the emblem of a quarter, three glimmering pieces adorned with a dime’s delicate engraving, three smaller tokens representing nickels, and five tiny fragments known as pennies. Each type of disc represented a different portion of sacred value in the ancient system.\n\nAccording to the forgotten lore, these metallic offerings combined to form a total sum, their values adding to a greater significance in the ceremony. Harriett knew that to unlock the full meaning of her find, she must understand the worth attributed to each type of token in this sequence of ten quarters, three dimes, three nickels, and five pennies.\n\nThe ancient texts hinted that by carefully combining these pieces—respecting their numbers and individual worth—one could reveal the total amount consecrated in the offering. This sum would illuminate what the ancient priests intended to signify through their ritual.\n\nThe challenge before Harriett was clear: determining the grand total value of the coins she had uncovered, piecing together the numerical mystery left behind by the lost civilization’s Number Rituals.\n\nWhat was the total amount of sacred value that Harriett found among those quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies?",

The route is well-charted, and the velocity at which one moves determines not only arrival but also the temporal resonance with the destination.\n\nAbel, known for his unwavering resolve, initiates his journey precisely at the zero cycle, steering his craft steadily at a velocity that translates to fifty miles traversed per hour. His departure echoes through the nexus, marked by a surge of anticipation. However, the traveler Alice holds a different rhythm; she commences her quest one full hour after Abel’s start, accelerating forward at a pace of forty miles per hour, eager yet measured in her advance.\n\nThe intricate weave of time and space within this universe demands a precise understanding: given Abel’s head start and higher velocity, and Alice’s delayed yet persistent pursuit, the question arises in the synchronization logs—how much sooner, measured in the smallest units of temporal cycles known here as minutes, does Abel arrive in Lumina before Alice’s craft touches down?\n\nDecoding this temporal offset requires an accurate reckoning of speed, distance, and departure intervals woven into the fabric of Andaria’s continuum. The goal of this synchronization effort is to quantify exactly how many minutes earlier Abel’s arrival resonates through the city gates of Lumina relative to Alice’s eventual arrival, illuminating the temporal gap forged by their different journeys.\n\nThis inquiry will inform future travel protocols and time coordination efforts among all who traverse these luminous paths. The logs await the final calculation that will reveal Abel’s advantage in arrival time, encoded in minutes, bridging logic and lore within Andaria’s temporal tapestry.",
    "answer": "If Abel needs to travel 1000 miles going 50 miles per hour, this means it will take him 1000/50=<<1000/50=20>>20 hours to get there.\nIf Alice needs to travel 1000 miles going 40 miles per hour, this means it will take her 1000/40=<<1000/40=25>>25 hours to get there.\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, this means it will take Abel 20*60= <<20*60=1200>>1200 minutes to arrive.\nSimilarly, this means it will take Alice 25*60= <<25*60=1500>>1500 minutes to arrive.\nThis means Abel arrives 1500-1200= <<1500-1200=300>>300 minutes before Alice if they both leave simultaneously.\nHowever, since Abel had a head start of 1 hour, which is 60 minutes, this means Abel arrives 300 + 60 = <<300+60=360>>360 minutes ahead of Alice\n#### 360",

However, fate is fickle: she encounters a setback that causes her to lose exactly one-third of her initial treasure. Undeterred, Lucy then bravely ventures forth but spends precisely one-fourth of what remains after her earlier loss, using her coins to overcome challenges and gain allies.\n\nAfter these trials, Lucy is left holding only 15 gold coins, a small but crucial amount that she must use to continue on her path. The game's puzzle now challenges players to reconstruct the amount of gold Lucy originally possessed, before the unfortunate loss and subsequent expenditure.\n\nTo master this quest, players must carefully consider the sequence of losses and spending, using logic and arithmetic reasoning consistent with the game's treasure management rules. The goal is to discover Lucy’s starting treasure, the foundation of her entire expedition.\n\nWhat was the total number of gold coins Lucy held at the very beginning of her adventure?",
    "answer": "The $15 is 1 - 1/4 = 3/4 of the money left.\nSince 3/4 is equal to $15, then 1/4 is equal to $15/3 = $5.\nSo Lucy had $5 x 4 = $<<5*4=20>>20 left after losing 1/3 of her money.\nHence, $20 is 1 - 1/3 = 2/3 of the money that Lucy had at the beginning.\nSince 2/3 is equal to $20, then 1/3 is equal to $20/2 = $10.\nTherefore, Lucy had $10 x 3 = $<<10*3=30>>30 at the beginning.\n#### 30",

    "question": "In the ancient grove where enchantments stirred the very air, the witch Trish upheld a curious daily ritual that was part exercise, part enchantment. Each dawn, she set forth on a path to commune with nature’s whispering secrets, covering a certain distance with measured steps that stirred the earth beneath her boots.\n\nOn the very first day of this ritual, Trish ventured exactly one mile through the verdant forest, the air rich with the scent of moss and damp leaves. The next morning, compelled by an old spell of growth and increase, she doubled the length she had travelled the day before. This doubling of distance became her unyielding rule; every succeeding day she strode forth twice as far as the previous dawn’s journey.\n\nAs days passed, the distance Trish ventured swelled dramatically—spreading farther into the wilderness, past ancient oaks and shimmering streams. The witch herself pondered this pattern, recognizing that with each sunrise, her footsteps traced a path exponentially larger, a magical progression that magnified her connection with the land.\n\nA curiosity took root in her wise mind: on which day would her step surpass a milestone so extraordinary it could be spoken of in awe? She sought the precise moment in time when the miles she roamed would be greater than ten times the distance she first walked—a threshold marking an extraordinary leap in her daily wanderings.\n\nHer spellbook lay open on the mossy stone nearby, inscribed with this very riddle, waiting for the day’s insight to unfold. The question now hung in the still air: after what count of mornings would Trish find herself traversing more than ten miles—the enchanted measure tenfold beyond that humble first mile?",
    "answer": "Trish walks 1 mile on the first day, and since she walks double the previous day's amount each day that means she walks 1*2=<<1*2=2>>2 miles the second day.\nOn the following day, she walks double the distance of the previous day's total of 2 miles, meaning she walks 2*2=<<2*2=4>>4 miles that day.\nOn the following day, she walks double the distance of the previous day's total of 4 miles, meaning she walks 4*2=<<4*2=8>>8 miles that day.\nOn the following day, she walks double the distance of the previous day's total of 8 miles, meaning she walks 8*2=<<8*2=16>>16 miles that day.\nAs we're looking for the first day that her distance exceeds 10 times her original total, that means we're seeking a mile total of greater than or equal to 10*1= <<10*1=10>>10 miles,\nSince she accomplished this on the 5th day of walking, the answer is <<5=5>>5.\n#### 5",

    "question": "Deep within the heart of the long-abandoned theme park, the faded blueprints of an old, once-thriving gift shop were rediscovered. These plans revealed pricing details from a forgotten era, including the cost of items that were once beloved by visitors. Among those treasures were spiral notebooks, priced at fifteen dollars each, cherished for their sturdy covers and vivid designs. Close by, personal planners—half the price at ten dollars each—had been favorites for park guests eager to organize their adventures.\n\nAccording to the documents, the shopkeeper had once prepared a special order: four spiral notebooks paired with eight personal planners. This combination was likely aimed at supplying a group of travelers who wished to jot down their memories and manage their itineraries with care. Intriguingly, the papers noted a generous twenty percent discount applied to this bundle, perhaps a promotional effort to encourage more purchases.\n\nThe mysterious purpose left behind in the blueprint was to determine the complete expense that this particular sale would have amounted to after the discount was applied. It was clear that the totals should reflect the original prices multiplied by the quantities and then adjusted to account for the twenty percent reduction.\n\nWandering through the dusty corridors of this relic, one couldn’t help but wonder: How much had those eager visitors saved on their purchases of spiral notebooks and planners by accessing this offer? And ultimately, what would the final total cost be, reflecting both the items chosen and the discount extended? The answer lay hidden in calculating the combined price, weighed and trimmed by the old shopkeeper’s thoughtful pricing scheme.",
    "answer": "If a spiral notebook cost $15, a 20% discount would reduce the price by 20/100 *15 = $<<15*0.2=3>>3\nAt a 20% discount, the buying price of a spiral notebook book is $15-$3= $<<15-3=12>>12\nAt the same discount, a personal planner cost would reduce by 20/100 * $10 = $<<20/100*10=2>>2\nThe new buying price of a personal planner will be $10-$2 =$<<10-2=8>>8\nTo buy four spiral notebooks at a 20% discount, you'll pay 4*$12 = $<<4*12=48>>48\nAt the same time discount, you'll buy eight personal planners at a cost pf 8*$8 = <<8*8=64>>64\nIn total, to buy eight personal planners and four spiral notebooks, you'd have to pay $64+$48 = $112\n#### 112",

    "question": "In the heart of the bustling city, preparations for the annual Lantern Festival were underway, and the event planners’ logbook recorded many tales of friendships and shared histories. Among these stories was the tale of three close friends whose lives intertwined under the glow of the festival lights. Their collective age was something that intrigued many, as it seemed to hold a secret about the harmony of their bond.\n\nAccording to the records, these three friends had an average age of forty years, an insight that spoke to their shared experiences and the maturity of their friendship. The logbook detailed a key relationship between two of them: Jared was known to be precisely ten years older than Hakimi, a detail that was well remembered by those who chronicled their stories. Molly, the third friend, had reached an age milestone of thirty, casting a youthful but steady light on their trio.\n\nThe puzzling entry in the logbook called for an understanding of Hakimi’s age from these intertwined lifelines. Just how old was Hakimi, given the balance of ages floating between these three companions? The record keepers had noted the average age, the specific gap between Jared and Hakimi, and Molly’s firm age as guiding points.\n\nTo unravel the mystery of Hakimi’s years, one would need to look deeply into these numbers, connecting each detail with the social reunion of years they represented. The festival’s narrative depended on this understanding, as it symbolized the passage of time and friendship beneath the lanterns that lit the city’s sky.\n\nWith these insights laid bare in the festival’s chronicles, the logbook paused, inviting those who read it to uncover just one vital piece of the puzzle—the age of Hakimi. What number would complete this trio’s story, illuminating the shared history of their friendship?",
    "answer": "The total age for the three friends is 40*3 = <<40*3=120>>120\nIf Molly's age is 30, then Jared and Hakimi have a total age of 120-30 = 90.\nLet's say the age of Hakimi is x.\nSince Jared is 10 years older than Hakimi, Jared is x+10 years old.\nJared and Hakimi's total age is x+(x+10) = 90\nThis translates to 2x=90-10\n2x=80\nHakimi's age is x=80/2\nThis gives us x=<<40=40>>40, which is Hamkimi's age.\n#### 40",

    "question": "In the sprawling interstellar facility known as the Xenoveil Conservation Habitat, a renowned explorer named Jane is part of an experimental fitness regimen designed specifically for the maintenance of her alien species’ peak agility. This habitat features a standardized running track that stretches exactly three thousand meters, a perfect circuit set within the containment zone’s outer ring.\n\nJane embarks on a measured exercise routine, completing a full lap of this three-kilometer track precisely in the span of two Earth hours—a carefully monitored period by the habitat’s timekeepers. Within the strict protocols of this routine, these two hours are continuous and uninterrupted, reflecting Jane's consistent effort over the entire distance.\n\nThe containment manual details the necessity of knowing how rapidly a being moves in smaller units to calibrate feeding and recovery schedules accurately. Hence, it’s essential to determine Jane’s movement rate at a more granular time scale—specifically, the number of meters she advances in each passing minute.\n\nEnvision the alien biome’s chronometer segmenting Jane’s performance into minute-long intervals to assess her stamina and speed accurately. The goal is to convert the total distance she covers, three thousand meters in two hours, into a standardized velocity expressed in meters traveled every minute.\n\nSuch precise calculations ensure the habitat's environmental controls and activity recommendations align perfectly with Jane’s kinetic data. Given these conditions and metrics, the core inquiry is: how many meters does Jane traverse in a single minute during her two-hour lap?",

This time, he has set his sights on creating a majestic pyramid structure that will serve as the centerpiece for a grand event inspired by ancient wonders. The pyramid is to be meticulously designed in three levels, each representing a tier of grandeur and architectural finesse.\n\nThe blueprint for this pyramid dictates that the foundation, or bottom level, must be expansive, with seven Legos forming each side, perfectly aligned to create a sturdy square base. Ascending from this broad bottom, the layers are meant to taper gracefully; thus, the second level should have one fewer Lego per side than the bottom, and the third level should reduce by another layer, also missing one Lego per side compared to the level below it. Each level forms a neat square, stacked above the other, showcasing a precise diminishing pattern that echoes the classic pyramid silhouette.\n\nBob understands that to realize this vision at the event, he must gather just the right number of Legos. The demand is not only for aesthetic accuracy but also for the logistical efficiency of transporting and assembling the pyramid on-site. Therefore, figuring out how many Legos he needs in total, counting every single piece in all three levels combined, is crucial for successful planning and budgeting.\n\nAs he sketches out the layout and discusses the event timeline with his team, the question lingers: How many Legos will Bob gather altogether to build this three-tiered pyramid, ensuring each level decreases uniformly by one Lego per side from its predecessor, starting with seven Legos on each side at the bottom?",

Among her favorite plants were two kinds that always caught the guests' eyes: tall, golden sunflowers and delicate, fluttering dandelions. Each morning, as Carla prepared her signature blends, she would also count the seeds from these plants, knowing that the seeds symbolized the vitality and hope she infused into her tea rituals.\n\nCarla’s garden proudly held six sunflowers, each blooming with exactly nine seeds nestled within their bright petals. Alongside them grew eight dandelion stalks, each carrying a slightly different charm but no less lively: every dandelion bore twelve seeds. Carla often mused about the balance between these two plants—how their seeds combined to inspire her community’s gatherings and celebrations in the tea house courtyard.\n\nTo understand the garden’s contribution to her tea house, Carla set out a task for herself one morning: she wished to discover how much of the entire seed collection come from the dandelions. It was more than just botanical curiosity; the seeds represented the spirit and story she poured into each cup served. She pondered, within the full collection of seeds gathered from both sunflowers and dandelions, what proportion was born from the dandelion plants alone.\n\nHer challenge was clear—to express this as a portion of the whole, but articulated in the way that one might speak of festival attendees or ingredients in a recipe, namely by using a percentage. This figure would reveal the share of dandelion seeds within the combined total gathered from all her plants.\n\nWhat Carla needed to find, then, was the percentage of her tea garden’s seeds that came specifically from the dandelions compared to the total seeds from both sunflowers and dandelions, capturing the essence of her garden’s story through this number.",
    "answer": "First calculate the number of seeds from the sunflowers by multiplying the number of sunflowers by the number of seeds per sunflower: 6 sunflowers * 9 seeds/sunflower = <<6*9=54>>54 seeds\nNext calculate the number of seeds from the dandelions by multiplying the number of dandelions by the number of seeds per dandelion: 8 dandelions * 12 seeds/dandelion = <<8*12=96>>96 seeds\nNow add the number of seeds from each group of plants to find the total number of seeds: 54 seeds + 96 seeds = <<54+96=150>>150 seeds\nNow divide the number of dandelion seeds by the total number of seeds and multiply the answer by 100 to find the percentage of seeds that come from the dandelions: 96 seeds / 150 seeds * 100% = 64%\n#### 64",

    "question": "Night fell over the grand Coal and Industry Museum, where the evening shift began under the watchful eyes of the night guards. Among them, the ten custodians were tasked with a seasonal challenge — shoveling piles of coal that fueled the historic steam engines on display. The team was well-oiled and steady: with ten workers, it typically took them a solid ten nights to clear an impressive mountain of 10,000 pounds of coal from the museum’s storage yard.\n\nThis well-practiced rhythm set the pattern for their work. Each night, equal effort meant equal progress, and the steady pace ensured that after those ten nights, the coal was cleared exactly as expected. But tonight, a new directive had shifted the plan. Only half of the original crew — five of the ten stalwart workers — were available to tend the coal stockpile. Meanwhile, the amount of coal to be shoveled had swelled dramatically, growing to a daunting 40,000 pounds, four times the usual amount.\n\nThe museum management had turned to the night guard’s foreman to estimate how long this reduced crew would need to complete the task, given the heavier workload. Their experience told them the total labor done was tied to both the number of workers and the days spent shoveling, but the question was how these quantities adapted when both workforce and coal quantity changed so markedly.\n\nBearing in mind the earlier project where the full team cleared 10,000 pounds in exactly ten nights, the foreman needed to determine how many nights five workers would require to clear four times that weight. The core of the problem lay in connecting these changes: a smaller team, a quadrupled workload, and the effort it would collectively demand over time.\n\nAs the clock ticked deeper into the night, the foreman prepared a report to calculate the number of nights the halved crew would need to clear all 40,000 pounds, ensuring the museum’s steam engines would never run out of their vital fuel. How many nights would this smaller team require to complete this quadrupled task?",
    "answer": "The 10 people shovel 10,000 pounds per 10 days, or 10,000/10=<<10000/10=1000>>1000 pounds per day per 10 people.\nAnd 1000 pounds per day per 10 people is 1000/10=<<1000/10=100>>100 pounds per day per person.\nHalf of ten people is 10/2=<<10/2=5>>5 people.\nAt 100 pounds per day per person, 5 people can shovel 5*100=<<5*100=500>>500 pounds per day.\nTherefore, for 5 people to shovel 40,000 pounds, it will take 40,000/500=<<40000/500=80>>80 days.\n#### 80",

    "question": "In the bustling trade city of Cartoria, the Postcard Routing Guild dealt with more than just letters—they coordinated the transportation of heavy cargo, including sacks of cement that weighed heavily on the city’s roadways. In the past month, the guild arranged the movement of a shipment consisting of eighty bags. Each bag was precisely fifty kilograms, and the transportation fee for this consignment was six thousand golden coins, a price agreed upon by the drivers and merchants.\n\nNow, a new challenge arises for the Postcard Routing Guild’s master coordinator. A merchant has requested the transportation of a significantly larger shipment, not just in quantity but differing in the weight characteristics of each bag. This new shipment consists of exactly three times as many bags as before, but each one weighs only three-fifths as much as the original fifty kilograms. The guild is tasked to determine how much the transportation would cost under these new parameters, given the historical cost tied to the previous shipment.\n\nThe guild’s tradition is to maintain a sensible relationship between the transport cost, the number of bags, and their individual weights. They understand that all parts of the shipment—number and weight—contribute proportionally to the final cost. The question now hinges on applying their cost-calculation wisdom to this new shipment, which changes the total weight involved in a distinctly measurable way.\n\nAs the guild strategizes, they reflect on how the cost for the eighty original bags weighing fifty kilograms each was six thousand golden coins. They must use this foundational information to figure out the cost when the shipment triples in bag number but reduces each bag’s weight to three-fifths of the original.\n\nWith these details clear in the Postcard Routing Guild’s ledger, the master coordinator poses the problem: considering the shipment that involves three times the number of bags, each bag at three-fifths the weight previously moved, what will be the total transportation cost to move this new combined load through Cartoria’s roads?",
    "answer": "Three times as many cement bags is 3*80 = <<3*80=240>>240 cement bags.\nIf a bag of cement weighs 50 kg, 3/5 times as much weight is 3/5*50 = <<3/5*50=30>>30 kgs.\nIf the cost of transporting 80 bags of cement, each weighing 50 kgs, is $6000, the cost of transporting one bag of cement weighing 50 kg is $6000/80 = $<<6000/80=75>>75\nSince a bag weighing 50 kgs costs $75 to transport, a bag weighing 30 kgs will cost 30* $75/50 = $<<30*75/50=45>>45 to transport.\nThe cost of transporting 240 cement bags each weighing 30 kgs is $45*240 = $<<45*240=10800>>10800\n#### 10800",

Her specialty lies in creating two beloved figures: graceful giraffes and majestic elephants, each formed from luminous jade mined from a faraway mountain. Every piece she carves becomes a gem in the world of collectible toys.\n\nNancy’s workshop follows careful standards. To carve a giraffe statue, she uses exactly 120 grams of jade, and when a customer buys one, it costs $150—a fair price reflecting the skill and beauty in each one. On the other hand, elephant statues require double the amount of jade that giraffes do, so each elephant is carved from 240 grams of jade. Because of their grandeur and the extra jade, these elephant statues sell for $350 apiece.\n\nToday, Nancy has 1920 grams of pure jade ready to be transformed into beautiful statues for her next toy catalog. She wonders about the best way to use all this jade: Should she craft only giraffes or only elephants? Each choice will determine how many statues she makes and the total earnings she receives once all are sold.\n\nNancy becomes curious—if she were to carve only elephant statues until all 1920 grams are used, she’d get a certain total amount of money from selling them. Alternatively, if she made only giraffe statues from the same jade supply, that total earnings figure would surely be different because of how much jade and money each type requires.\n\nHer challenge is to figure out just how much more money she would earn by turning all the jade into elephant statues rather than giraffes. She needs an answer that will guide her next big order and shine in her new toy catalog.\n\nGiven all these conditions—the jade weights, prices per statue, and total jade on hand—how much extra income will Nancy make by choosing elephants over giraffes for this batch?",

This tree was no ordinary one; it had exactly thirty sturdy branches, each intricately woven with countless twigs, whispering secrets to the passing breeze. Day after day, James observed the delicate patterns of its growth, fascinated by the way nature balanced complexity and order.\n\nJames knew each branch held ninety twigs, a fact he had carefully counted to ensure the precision of his observations. But the real intrigue lay in the leaves that blossomed on these twigs. Nearly one-third of all the twigs bore four leaves apiece, lending a light, delicate touch to the tree’s foliage. The remainder, however, were more generous, each sprouting five leaves, giving the tree a lush, fuller appearance.

They want to know the updated measure of his success—a percentage that reflects all the games he has played so far, weaving together his past victories and recent defeats into one grand statistic.\n\nThe question lingering in the festive air is: after adding these newest 100 matches, of which Bill lost 43, what will be the new percentage of games where Bill emerges victorious? How does this updated figure reflect his true standing in the parade queue? The festival’s tallykeepers seek to calculate this new win percentage, capturing the evolving saga of Bill’s game mastery beneath the vibrant flutter of festival banners.",
    "answer": "First find the total number of games Bill has won: 200 games * 63% = <<200*63*.01=126>>126 games\nThen find how many of the next 100 games he wins by subtracting the number he loses from the total: 100 games - 43 games = <<100-43=57>>57 games\nThen add his new wins to his old wins to find his total wins: 57 games + 126 games = <<57+126=183>>183 games\nThen add the old total number of games to the new total number of games to find the overall total number of games: 200 games + 100 games = <<200+100=300>>300 games\nThen divide the total number of games Bill won by the overall total number of games and multiply by 100% to find the percentage of games he won: 183 games / 300 games * 100% = 61%\n#### 61",

    "question": "In the cozy corner of her school library, Rita settled down with a new book she had just borrowed—a story divided neatly into five chapters. The book promised a good adventure, and she was eager to dive into each part. Its total length stretched to 95 pages, which seemed just perfect for a week’s worth of reading.\n\nAs she flipped through the pages, Rita noticed something interesting about the chapters. Each chapter had a bit more to read than the one before it. Specifically, every new chapter added three pages beyond the length of the previous chapter, so the chapters were not all the same size but grew steadily as the story unfolded.\n\nCurious about how this story was structured, Rita decided to figure out how many pages were in each part. She knew the entire book had five chapters, and the total number of pages across these chapters was exactly 95. With each chapter increasing by three pages compared to the previous one, she wanted to understand how many pages started it all—the length of the very first chapter.\n\nWith this in mind, Rita began jotting down notes, wanting to uncover the exact number of pages that composed that very first chapter. She kept in mind the friendly rule that each chapter was three pages longer than the one before, building up to the full 95 pages in all.\n\nNow, with the story’s details laid out and her curiosity set, Rita wondered: what was the number of pages in the first chapter of the book?",
    "answer": "Let P be the number of pages in the first chapter.\nThe second chapter has P + 3 pages.\nThe third chapter has P + 3 + 3 = P + <<+3+3=6>>6 pages.\nThe fourth chapter has P + 6 + 3 = P + <<+6+3=9>>9 pages.\nThe fifth chapter has P + 9 + 3 = P + <<+9+3=12>>12 pages.\nThe whole book has P + 3 + P + 6 + P + 9 + P + 12 = 5P + 30 = 95 pages.\nThus, without the 30 extra pages from additional chapters, 5P = 95 - 30 = 65 pages.\nTherefore, the first chapter had P = 65 / 5 = <<65/5=13>>13 pages.\n#### 13",

    "question": "Survivor Log: Entry 47\n\nIn the fractured remnants of the old world, resources were scarce and every moment of clarity mattered more than ever. Two young survivors, Isabella and Antonio, wandered the wasteland together under the shelter of a ruined outpost. Despite the harshness surrounding them, the bond between these two was their beacon of hope and continuity.\n\nWithin their small tribe of survivors, age was vital—especially to allocate responsibilities and rations. Isabella had always been regarded as older and more experienced, and it was known that she was exactly twice the age of Antonio. Time, however, still marched relentlessly; in another 18 months, Isabella was expected to reach a milestone age of ten years. This was a crucial marker not only for their growth but in securing their path in the clan’s hierarchy.\n\nTheir leader needed to understand the precise ages of these two to assign roles in the community’s survival plan. Knowing Isabella’s age milestones allowed everyone to prepare properly, but Antonio’s current age remained unclear. Since Isabella was twice as old as Antonio today, and would be ten years old in 18 more months, the balance of their ages could provide the needed insight.\n\nThe challenge was clear: by connecting the dots between Isabella’s future age and the relationship she shared with Antonio’s age now, the survivors hoped to decode Antonio’s exact age measured not in years—but in months, the currency of time in the wasteland.\n\nHow many months old was Antonio when Isabella’s age was exactly twice his and she was destined to turn ten years old after those 18 long months?",
    "answer": "First, we determine that Isabella will be 10*12= <<10*12=120>>120 months old at age 10, to find a number to compare her age to Antonio's with.\nThen we subtract the 18 months from the total of 120 months to find 120-18= <<120-18=102>>102 months, which is the age Isabella is currently.\nSince at 102 months old Isabella is twice as old as Antonio, we take 102/2= <<102/2=51>>51 months as Antonio's age.\n#### 51",

Two agents, Hugo and Tom, are tasked with a high-stakes mission that requires them to prepare hundreds of covert containers before dawn. Each container holds secrets vital to their cause, and the faster these boxes are folded, the sooner they can vanish into the night undetected.\n\nHugo, known for his rapid agility, folds a small courier box in just three seconds. However, the medium-sized boxes are more complex, taking him twice as long—six seconds each. Tom, on the other hand, shows remarkable consistency, deftly folding both small and medium boxes in exactly four seconds apiece. Together, they face a monumental task: preparing 2400 small boxes alongside 1800 medium boxes.\n\nTheir covert operation demands not only speed but coordination; the faster these boxes are ready, the quicker they can execute their plan and evade any looming threats. Each second counts, and every box folded brings them closer to slipping away unnoticed.\n\nThe question hangs heavy in the air: working in tandem, how fast can Hugo and Tom fold all 2400 small boxes and 1800 medium boxes to ensure they leave the scene as soon as possible? What is the minimum amount of time, measured in seconds, required to accomplish this critical task?\n\nIn this perilous dance of efficiency and secrecy, unraveling the answer means the difference between success and capture. How rapidly can the duo complete their task under these constraints, maximizing their combined efforts while handling their respective strengths?",
    "answer": "If it takes Hugo twice the amount of time to fold a medium box than a small box, then he needs 2*3 = <<6=6>>6 seconds for the medium box\nIf Tom can fold either the small or medium box in 4 seconds, then he's faster at folding the medium box than Hugo because 4s < 6s\nIf Hugo can fold the small box in 3 seconds, then he's faster at folding the small boxes than Tom because 3s < 4s\nTherefore Hugo should fold all small boxes and Tom should fold all the medium ones before doing the other size where they are slower\nIf there are 2400 small boxes and Hugo can fold 1 box in 3 seconds, then it would take him 2400*3 = <<2400*3=7200>>7200 seconds to fold all boxes\nIf there are 1800 medium boxes and Tom can fold 1 box in 4 seconds, then it would take him 1800*4 = <<1800*4=7200>>7200 seconds to fold all medium boxes\nGiven that they need the same amount of time to fold all boxes, and are doing it simultaneously they will need 7200 seconds to fold all the boxes\n#### 7200",

She has entered the sacred chamber of creation—a kitchen of vast proportions, twelve feet in breadth and sixteen feet in length, crowned by ceilings soaring ten feet high. The walls of this chamber await the touch of her skilled hand to awaken their hidden beauty.\n\nThe divine decree for this trial is exacting. Martha must cloak each of the four sacred walls in a protective veil: first, a single layer of the mystic primer to prepare the surface, followed by not one, but two successive coats of the enchanted paint, each enriching and sealing the walls with magical vigor. It is said that only through this triple layering can the chamber reach the splendor demanded by the ancient rites.\n\nThough Martha’s hands are swift and steady, the gods have measured her toil—she is gifted with the power to transform forty square feet of wall every hour into a masterpiece of color and strength. The sands of time run ever forward, and the challenge is as much to conquer the hours as it is the walls themselves.\n\nBefore Martha begins, the council of elders asks: given the chamber’s size and the sacred process of layering primer and paint, how many hours will her effort require? To triumph, one must calculate the total expanse she must cover, with all its mystical coatings, and measure it against her blessed pace.\n\nThis knowledge not only determines her victory but sets the rhythm of her labor, a precise harmony between divine instruction and mortal endurance. How many hours will Martha dedicate to completing this sacred painting, fulfilling the gods’ rigorous trial and bringing the chamber to life?",
    "answer": "There are two walls that are 12' X 10' and two walls that are 16' by 10'. First find the size in square feet of one 12' x 10' wall by multiplying the height and length: 12 ft * 10 ft = <<12*10=120>>120 sq ft\nMultiply that quantity by 2 since there are two 12' x 10' walls: 120 sq ft * 2 = <<120*2=240>>240 sq ft\nThen find the size in square feet of one 16' x 10' wall by multiplying the height and length: 16 ft * 10 ft = <<16*10=160>>160 sq ft\nMultiply that quantity by 2 since there are two 16' x 10' walls: 160 sq ft * 2 = <<160*2=320>>320 sq ft\nNow add the square footage of both sets of walls to find the total square footage Martha needs to paint: 240 sq ft+ 320 sq ft = <<240+320=560>>560 sq ft\nNow multiply that amount by 3 because Martha needs to add 3 coats: 560 sq ft/coat * 3 coats = <<560*3=1680>>1680 sq ft\nFinally, divide the total square footage by Martha's painting rate to find how many hours she needs to finish: 1680 sq ft / 40 sq ft/hour = <<1680/40=42>>42 hours\n#### 42",

    "question": "In the sprawling corridors of the Temporal Regulation Authority, where the fabric of time itself was meticulously monitored, two unique temporal zones named Square A and Square B held great significance. These zones, represented as two-dimensional fields, were pivotal regions designated for time travel calibration tests. Each zone’s boundary was defined by equal-length edges forming perfect squares, enveloping a specific area of temporal influence.\n\nSquare A, the smaller temporal zone, was known to encapsulate an exact span of 25 temporal units squared within its boundary. Meanwhile, Square B was a more expansive realm in the timeline, covering a spread of 81 temporal units squared. The regulation team understood that the physical length of each zone’s side directly governed the stability and intensity of temporal energy flowing through it, making these distances crucial for precise temporal calibrations.\n\nThe Temporal Regulation Officers needed to compare the two zones by determining how much longer the boundary of Square B was along one side compared to that of Square A. Since these sides defined the dimensional limits within which time travelers could safely operate, understanding the difference in their side lengths was essential for configuring equipment and programming safe transit protocols.\n\nWithin this framework, they already had the respective areas of these squares as 25 and 81 temporal units squared. The next challenge was to translate these area magnitudes into actual linear side measurements and then find the precise difference between these lengths to ensure all safety measures aligned perfectly.\n\nThus, the core of this temporal mathematics dilemma lay in identifying the length difference in the edges that enclosed each temporal zone—Square A and Square B—using their known areas before any time jump operations could commence. What was the exact difference in side lengths between these two temporal regulation zones?",

Each floor is a delicate tapestry of ten radiant apartments, and each apartment hums softly with the presence of four dream-weavers—unique souls who shape the very fabric of dreams in this floating metropolis.\n\nYour challenge begins with understanding the building’s enchanting occupancy pattern. Half of the floors—six in total—are completely alive, brimming with all their apartments fully inhabited by these dream-weavers. The other half shares a more balanced state: each of those six floors is only half-awake, with exactly half of their apartments occupied, while the rest drift quietly empty, savoring the calm.\n\nWith this knowledge of occupancy, the murmuring question lingers in the air: given that every fully occupied apartment contains four dream-weavers, how many dream-weavers are dancing within the entire building’s luminous walls? Your goal is to unravel the total population breathing life into this dreamscape, weaving all the partial and full fills into one harmonious count.\n\nWithin this simulation, your calculations must reflect the building’s dual nature—half alive with full vibrancy, half in partial slumber, and every apartment a capsule for four imaginative denizens.

    "question": "In the bustling virtual world of SocialNetia, every move a user makes can be tracked and measured, much like a journey through a dynamic digital landscape. Luis, a rising influencer, decides to embark on a streaming spree, during which his digital avatar travels through diverse brand zones, gaining momentum and followers as he moves.\n\nOver the course of a two-hour live stream, Luis’s avatar glides through these zones at a steady pace, covering an impressive span of eighty digital miles within that time frame. This consistent speed becomes known among his followers, as it reflects his ability to maintain engagement and attract more viewers steadily without losing energy.\n\nThe platform’s analytics team wants to simulate what would happen if Luis were to stream for just fifteen minutes, a quarter of the original two-hour session. They’re curious about how far his avatar would realistically journey in that brief interval, assuming it maintains the same energetic flow and momentum that created the eighty-mile distance in two hours.\n\nTo themselves, they note that if the avatar’s pace stays consistent, the distance covered should logically match the time proportion—faster or slower movements would change the reach accordingly. This proportional thinking is essential for forecasting future streaming sessions and engagement levels.\n\nBehind the scenes, the goal is to determine exactly how many digital miles Luis’s avatar would traverse in those fifteen minutes of streaming, grounded in the established pace of the original two-hour journey. Understanding this will help anticipate reach and optimize Luis’s upcoming short streams.\n\nWith these pieces in place, what is the virtual distance Luis’s avatar would cover during that fifteen-minute span under the same streaming pace?",
    "answer": "Luis drives 80/2 = <<80/2=40>>40 miles in 1 hour.\nSince there are 60 minutes in 1 hour, then he drives 40/60 = 2/3 of a mile in 1 minute.\nSo in 15 minutes, he will go 2/3 x 15 = <<2/3*15=10>>10 miles far.\n#### 10",

    "question": "In the bustling Genetic Algorithm Lab, where virtual populations evolve to solve complex problems, Megan found herself engaged not with code, but with a curious real-world scenario. The lab’s latest experiment was to model economic behaviors within evolved agents, and Megan, as one of the researchers, decided to test a simple yet intriguing transaction. She purchased an item—a shirt integral to understanding adaptive spending behaviors.\n\nThis shirt, tagged at a pre-sale value of twenty-two dollars, represented the maximum price point that the agent population might consider in their simulated market. However, Megan managed to acquire it for only sixteen dollars during a special discount event, reflecting a modification in market dynamics that was crucial for the upcoming genetic simulations. The difference in purchase price and original pricing would serve as a vital variable in the fitness function governing economic decision-making.\n\nIn this scenario, Megan’s real-world spending showcases the concept of discounting: the careful reduction from the initial fixed worth to a lowered price—an adjustment that agents in the simulation must learn to respond to. The amount by which the price was reduced influences how the population might evolve strategies around timing and negotiation for purchases.\n\nGiven this setup, the task is to determine the exact monetary difference—the discount—that was applied to the shirt’s original price, framing this as a clear parameter for tuning the evolutionary model. Understanding this value will help in encoding reward signals for agents emulating consumer behavior under price variance.\n\nTherefore, the essential question remains: what is the amount of the discount that Megan obtained, expressed in precise dollars, to inform the lab’s genetic algorithm parameters?",
    "answer": "Let x be the amount of the discount.\nWe have, 22 - x = $16\nWe change the writing of the equation:\n22 - x + x = 16 + x\nSo, 22 = 16 + x\nWe then Remove 16 from both sides:\n22 - 16 = 16 + x - 16\nSo, 22 - 16 = x\nSo, the amount of the discount is x = $<<6=6>>6.\n#### 6",

    "question": "In the midst of a sprawling 18th-century battlefield camp, a young quartermaster named Elliott was tasked with mapping out simple fortifications for a temporary outpost. Amidst the clatter of muskets and the murmur of soldiers planning their next move, Elliott carefully drew the layout of a small triangular earthwork on a piece of parchment. The shape he sketched was crucial for the defense plan, representing a right-angled triangle.\n\nThe base of this triangle, marking the front line shielded by sturdy wooden planks, stretched exactly four inches across Elliott’s drawn map. Perpendicular to this base, the height—symbolizing the trench dug deep for protecting troops—stood three inches tall on the parchment. The direct slanting path, the hypotenuse between two corners of the defense, remained to be precisely measured, as its length was yet unknown on the map.\n\nElliott’s goal was to understand the entire stretch of this triangular defense’s outline—essentially, the full perimeter from one corner to the next, traveling along the base, up the height, and back along the hypotenuse connecting these points. Knowing this measurement was critical to allocate the right number of soldiers and resources needed to man the positions along the fortification without overextending their limited forces.\n\nAs he sat by the campfire, he pondered how to combine the known lengths—four inches for the base and three inches for the height—with the unknown hypotenuse, to calculate the total length around the earthwork’s edges. The ability to determine the exact perimeter would ensure the defense was neither too sparse nor unnecessarily stretched thin.\n\nIn this tense yet methodical moment on the battlefield, Elliott’s calculations would decide how well the outpost could hold against approaching enemy lines, balancing precision and prudence in the art of fortification.\n\nWhat was the full length of the perimeter encompassing the triangular fortification Elliott had drawn, including the unknown hypotenuse?",
    "answer": "Since the hypotenuse of a triangle is found by the square root of the base squared plus the height squared.\nThe square of the base of the first triangle is 4*4=<<4*4=16>>16 square inches\nThe square of the height of the first triangle is 3*3=<<3*3=9>>9 square inches.\nThe sum of the squares of the base and the height of the first triangle is 16+9=<<16+9=25>>25\nThe square root of the sum of the base and the height of the first triangle, which is the hypotenuse of the triangle, is √25=5 inches.\nSince the perimeter of a triangle is found by adding the sides of the triangle, the base and height of the triangle sum up to 3+4=<<3+4=7>>7 inches\nIf you add the hypotenuse of the triangle the perimeter of the triangle becomes 7+5=<<7+5=12>>12 inches.\n#### 12",

    "question": "In the bustling realm of Eldoria, nestled among snow-dusted mountains and frost-kissed forests, stood the famed Winter’s Respite Inn. Karen, the innkeeper and a shrewd steward of resources, now faced a critical decision as the harshest winters approached. To protect herself against the biting cold, she sought a sturdy winter coat befitting her needs.\n\nThe first coat available from the mystical clothier was a finely crafted garment, woven with enchanted threads, priced at three hundred gold coins. This coat bore an enchantment that promised to endure even the fiercest winters for a span of fifteen years, providing warmth and protection like no other. The alternative, a simpler garment costing only one hundred and twenty gold coins, bore no lasting enchantments but could still fend off the cold—for a shorter period of five years only.\n\nAs Karen pored over her ledger by the flickering hearth, she wondered about a long-term strategy. If she were to prepare for thirty years of winters, she needed to understand how her choice would affect her coffers over that time. Would investing in the costly enchanted coat now yield financial benefits across the decades that followed? Or would the less expensive but shorter-lived garment serve her better in gold saved?\n\nHer task then was clear—she must calculate the difference in gold spent over three full decades between purchasing one of the enduring enchanted coats and repeatedly buying the simpler coat as it wore out. This meant carefully weighing the total cost of several cheaper coats against the cost of the single expensive coat’s longer service, framed within the measures of Eldorian wisdom and thrift.\n\nWith parchment and quill in hand, Karen prepared to determine how much wealth she might preserve through her choice—an answer hidden within the careful balance of cost and durability, waiting to guide her future decisions and keep her warm against the coming cold.\n\nHow many gold coins would Karen save if she chose the more expensive enchanted coat instead of the simpler garment over the span of thirty winters?",
    "answer": "First find the number of cheaper coats Karen will have to purchase over 30 years: 30 years / 5 years/coat = <<30/5=6>>6 coats\nThen multiply that number by the cost of one cheaper coat to find the total cost of that option: 6 coats * $120/coat = $<<6*120=720>>720\nThen find the number of more expensive coats Karen will have to purchase over 30 years: 30 years / 15 years/coat = <<30/15=2>>2 coats\nThen multiply that number by the cost of one expensive coat to find the total cost of that option: 2 coats * $300/coat = $<<2*300=600>>600\nThen subtract the total cost of the more expensive coats from the total cost of the less expensive coats to find the difference: $720 - $600 = $<<720-600=120>>120\n#### 120",

Mr. Bernard, the dignified and enigmatic gentleman of the house, was known for his precise habits and cryptic references to the passage of years. Nearby, young Luke, a sprightly man of twenty summers, was often found wandering through the maze of hallways and locked rooms, pondering the mysteries of the manor—and of his own place within it.\n\nOne evening, as the dim light flickered from the ancient chandelier, a peculiar riddle was whispered to Luke by the ghostly echoes of the mansion’s past. It was said that in eight years’ time, Mr. Bernard’s age would weave a curious relationship with Luke’s present youth: precisely three times the number of years Luke has lived so far. This mysterious link between their ages seemed to bind the mansion’s secrets with the steady march of time, a numerical puzzle hiding behind the walls of the estate.\n\nLuke knew his current age well—twenty years—and felt the weight of this strange prophecy pressing upon him. The riddle went deeper still, hinting at a hidden calculation: from the average of their ages, some quantity must be decreased by ten—an unknown, vital number that could unlock more than just an answer, perhaps a door or a truth concealed within the estate’s labyrinth.\n\nAs the candles guttered and shadows tangled, Luke realized that to unravel the mystery, he must first understand the connection between their ages now and in the years to come. The task was clear but challenging: to discern the nature of this age-bound enigma and determine the precise value that emerges when ten is subtracted from the average of their current years.\n\nWith every footstep echoing across the cold marble floors, the puzzle awaited its solution—a solution that held the promise of revelation, locked safely within the interplay of ages and numbers. What then was the number that stands ten less than the average of Mr. Bernard’s and Luke’s ages, a riddle poised to unlock new realms within the mansion’s ancient heart?",

    "question": "In the kingdom of Eldoria, powerful families often gathered to negotiate wealth and influence, aware that fairness in distribution could sway allegiances and secure lasting peace. Lady Carmela, a noble with a coffers holding exactly seven gold coins, faced such a situation with her four cousins, each one possessing only two gold coins in their own purses. A delicate balance of resources was at stake within their familial alliance.\n\nThe custom in Eldoria dictated that when wealth was uneven, a redistribution was often arranged to ensure equality among close kin, preserving unity and harmony within the noble house. Carmela considered sharing some of her gold so that she and her four cousins would each hold the exact same sum. Yet, how many gold coins must she give to every one of her cousins so that not only their fortunes but also their political strength would stand equal?\n\nThe Lair of Elders required her to map out this equitable transfer precisely, for an unfair offer could diminish her standing or cause rifts in the family’s collective power. They tasked her to clearly understand: once gold is moved from her purse to hers cousins’, what exact number of coins per cousin ensures that each noble relative commands an identical treasury of coins?\n\nWith responsibility weighing on her shoulders, Lady Carmela pondered how to solve this riddle. What amount, shared equally among her four cousins from her own seven coins, will place every member, Carmela and her cousins alike, on equal and solid footing?\n\nIt was clear that this calculation must be made through careful deduction, honoring the custom and securing the strength of the house. The challenge lay in determining the exact number of gold coins to be bestowed upon each cousin to achieve perfect equality within their ranks.",

Known throughout the land for her careful management of funds, Abigail recently embarked on her usual round of expenditures, each carefully noted to maintain the balance of her household treasury.\n\nOne moonlit evening, Abigail opened her purse and began to allocate her wealth. She first dedicated sixty parts out of every hundred to provisions, ensuring her larder was well-stocked with the finest food the markets could offer. From the treasure that remained, she then set aside one quarter to settle the charge of her magical communication orb—a device essential for speaking with distant kin across the realm.\n\nNot before closing her accounts for the day, Abigail enjoyed some merriment, spending exactly twenty golden coins on entertainment, a rare yet treasured delight.

The factory’s planning board noted that the current meal provisions comfortably accommodated the entire team, matching the 600 cans precisely to the 40 people expected to partake.\n\nHowever, on an unusual shift, the factory decided to operate with slightly fewer hands on deck—specifically, a workforce reduced by thirty percent compared to the usual 40. This adjustment meant fewer plates to fill and a smaller communal hunger to satisfy during the same meal period. The challenge arose in determining the correct number of cans to stock for this smaller group to maintain the perfected balance of sustenance per person without excess waste.\n\nWithin the specifications of the factory’s automation blueprint, this task involved translating the original provisioning ratio into the new scenario, ensuring that each of the reduced workforce still received the equivalent portion of stew as before.

    "question": "In the ever-twisting alleys of the Shifting Labyrinth, there lived a young woman named Brittany, renowned for her radiant hair that shimmered like moonlight on enchanted silver. In this realm where time itself wove unpredictable patterns, personal care was a daily ritual balanced delicately with the labyrinth’s enigmatic cadence. Among the many whispered secrets was Brittany's method of nurturing her hair — a potion of cleansing she measured with exact care, drawing precisely one quarter of an ounce from her sacred vial on every second day.\n\nHer supply was not endless; Brittany procured her precious potion in stout bottles, each holding fourteen ounces of the shimmering liquid. The bottles were prized artifacts—each one a treasure chest capable of sustaining her hair’s magic through many moons. Yet in the coming cycle, the labyrinth’s usual orbit would expand, granting an extra day—a leap year’s blessing and challenge alike.\n\nWith this additional day stretching the year to three hundred sixty-six cycles of dawn, Brittany wondered how many of the sacred fourteen-ounce vessels she must secure. To keep her ritual unbroken, she had to account for the precise measurements taken every other day throughout this extended rhythm. Each use, her carefully measured quarter-ounce would vanish into the labyrinth’s secret streams, leaving her ever watchful of her dwindling supply.\n\nThe task was clear yet intricate: to foresee the total number of vessels needed so that no moment would be left unwashed in her annual journey through the shifting maze of days. This quest involved unraveling the pattern of her potion’s use and the supply contained within each bottle, all in the context of an elusive, enlarged year.\n\nAs Brittany prepared to journey through the labyrinth’s extended cycle, what was the exact number of these vital bottles she must procure to see her through the year’s ever-shifting turns without faltering in her ritual care?",
    "answer": "A leap year is one day shorter than a regular year, so it is 365 – 1 = <<365-1=364>>364 days.\nBrittany washes her hair every other day, so she will wash it 364 / 2 = <<364/2=182>>182 times in a leap year.\nA bottle of shampoo lasts her 14 / 1 / 4 = 14 * 4 = 56 washes.\nIf she buys 3 bottles, she will only have enough for 56 * 3 = <<3*56=168>>168 washes.\nIf she buys 4 bottles, she will have enough for 56 * 4 = <<4*56=224>>224 washes.\nSince 168 < 182 and 224 > 182, Brittany needs 4 bottles of shampoo to get her through a leap year.\n#### 4",

Half of these cats held a secret: they were female, their essence shimmering with the potential of new life rippling through the labyrinth's folds.\n\nEach of these female cats had recently birthed exactly seven kittens, tiny beings that pulsed with the energy of countless timelines converging. Yet, the labyrinth demanded balance, and Matt found himself needing to part with nine of these delicate kittens, releasing them into the echoes of unexplored realities.\n\nNow, standing amidst the swirling pathways, Matt couldn’t help but wonder about the delicate ratio between his seasoned temporal cats and the newborn kittens filling the labyrinth’s air with new possibilities. With some felines sold, how did the family composition shift in this maze of moments?\n\nThe task before Matt was clear: he needed to find, within the labyrinth’s ever-shifting logic, the percentage of his remaining cats who were still kittens. This value had to be rounded to the nearest whole percent, revealing the true scale of new life nestled alongside his timeless companions.\n\nWhat percentage of the cats still under Matt’s watchful eyes were young kittens, amid the temporal complexity of the labyrinth’s dance?",

    "question": "In the ancient kingdom of Numeria, long forgotten beneath the sands of time, scholars practiced sacred reading rituals to honor the wisdom of their ancestors. Among them was Anna, a devoted seeker of knowledge, who possessed a revered manuscript divided into thirty-one glyph-inscribed chapters. Each chapter was a puzzle of thought, requiring exactly twenty minutes of focused contemplation under the flickering flame of a mystic lantern.\n\nThe elders of Numeria had decreed a peculiar rule for the ritual: any chapter whose number could be evenly divided by the number three was deemed a shadowed text, too potent and cryptic for casual reading. Thus, Anna was forbidden from studying these shadowed chapters, passing over them silently as she moved through the manuscript’s sacred sequence. She embarked on her journey through the remaining illuminated chapters, each a beacon of insight unmarred by the triadic shadows.\n\nThe challenge before Anna was to honor this triadic decree while unlocking the total expanse of knowledge she could acquire. For every allowed chapter, she committed twenty minutes of serene reading, but she yearned to know how many full cycles of hours her ritual would consume when the final glow of the lantern dimmed.\n\nAs Anna prepared to meditate upon the manuscript, the question weighed upon her mind: given the exclusion of those chapters bound by the triadic shadow and the time each luminous chapter demanded, how many complete hours would her reading ritual span before its fulfillment?",

On the forest floor lay exactly two thousand pinecones, a vital resource consumed and repurposed by native fauna and settlers alike.\n\nAccording to the latest ecological data stream, twenty percent of these pinecones were consumed by the woodland reindeer herds, beings revered for their harmony with the environment. Intriguingly, the squirrel clans exhibit a different pattern: they ingest twice the number of pinecones as the reindeer, reflecting their high-energy needs and gathering habits. Following this natural consumption, the remaining pinecones were not left idle. A quarter of what was left after these meals were carefully harvested by the hearthkeepers—local denizens who gather pinecones to fuel their signature woodfires, essential for their warmth and crafting rituals.\n\nThe synchronization protocol requires us to accurately determine the final count of pinecones remaining on the forest floor once these cycles of consumption and collection have concluded. Understanding this tally is crucial for maintaining ecological balance projections and ensuring sustainable resource planning in future seasonal assessments.\n\nWhat is the precise number of pinecones left scattered on the forest floor after the reindeer feeding, squirrel consumption, and hearthkeeper collection have all taken their due?",

This trainer caught a group of fish monsters from the nearby Whispering Lakes—an amount always carefully chosen to preserve harmony and promote growth. Intriguingly, the number of fish caught was exactly four fewer than the current enigmatic population dwelling within the Crystal Basin itself, which at this moment holds precisely twenty fish monsters.\n\nWith great care, these newly caught fish were introduced into the tank, their arrival poised to shift the pulse of energy. The trainer reflected on this addition, curious to quantify the precise number of newcomers joining the aquatic enclave. Understanding this number is crucial, as it influences the monster synergy and the next crucial phase of evolution that the basin’s inhabitants will undergo.\n\nThe task is to determine just how many fish monsters the trainer brought from the wild lakes, given that this number is four less than the existing twenty fish that already call the Crystal Basin home.\n\nIn this world where every fish counts and evolutions hinge on balance and growth, the trainer seeks to unlock the key figure—the count of the freshly added fish monsters—to plan the next steps in the evolution journey of the aquatic tribe. How many fish monsters were added to the Crystal Basin from the Whispering Lakes?",
    "answer": "Let's say the number of fish that was in the tank before was x\nIf you caught 4 fewer fish than the number that was there, then you caught x-4\nAfter adding x-4 fish into the tank, the tank now had 20 fish, meaning the total number of fish in the tank is x+x-4=20\n2x=20+4\nThe total number of fish that was initially in the tank is 2x=24\nInitially, there were x=24/2 fish in the tank\nx=<<12=12>>12\nIf you caught 4 fewer fish than the number in my tank initially, you caught 12-4=<<12-4=8>>8 fish.\n#### 8",

    "question": "In the shadowed corners of a witch’s alchemy tower, Wendy the enchantress has taken up a peculiar task—one far removed from the bubbling cauldrons and glowing potions she usually crafts. This time, she is entrusted with the delicate art of packaging enchanted chocolates, each imbued with a sprinkle of magical essence, meant for distribution across the realm. Her workspace is a cluttered chamber lined with shelves heavy with jars of mystical ingredients, but before her lies a simple task: to prepare these delights for the journey ahead.\n\nWendy’s method is precise and rhythmic. With practiced hands, she bundles chocolates into groups precisely numbering two dozen—a magical measure of 24 confections, wrapped and sealed with a whispered incantation. It takes her exactly five minutes to complete one such batch, carefully counting and packing them without haste. The flow of her work mimics the steady ticking of an ancient timekeeper’s clock, each group a testament to her unwavering focus.\n\nAs the sun arcs high and shadows lengthen, Wendy is set a challenge by her master: to predict how many individual chocolates she will have packaged after a long stretch of commitment, four hours spent without interruption. The master’s question lingers in the air of the mystic chamber—how many chocolates, each lovingly wrapped and sealed in those twelves-and-twelves bundles, will Wendy have prepared when the four-hour glass has completely run through its sands?\n\nTo uncover the answer, one must fold together time’s steady march and Wendy’s unwavering pace. How many units of five minutes are contained in those four full hours? And from that, how many chocolates emerge, multiplied endlessly by the dozens she forms with each careful set? The question is one of both regularity and endurance, tethered firmly to the rhythm Wendy upholds in this magical factory of delights.\n\nThe task remains clear, a puzzle blending measurement and magic: after all is done, what is the total count of individual chocolates Wendy will have packed? This final number will reveal the fruits of her tireless hands and steady heart over those four endless hours steeped in enchantment and diligent labor.",
    "answer": "There are 60 minutes in an hour and she packs chocolate in 5-minute increments. So that's 60/5 = <<60/5=12>>12 5 minute increments in 1 hour\n12 chocolates make 1 dozen and she packages 2 dozen in 5 minutes so that's 12*2 = <<12*2=24>>24 chocolates in 5 minutes\n12 5 minute increments are in an hour and she packages 24 chocolates in 5 minutes so she can package 12*24 = <<12*24=288>>288 individual chocolates in 1 hour\nIf she packages 288 individual chocolates in 1 hour then in 4 hours she can package 288*4 = <<288*4=1152>>1,152 individual chocolates\n#### 1152",

    "question": "In the forgotten heart of an abandoned theme park lay a peculiar storage room, untouched for decades. Among stacks of dusty crates, one particular box captured the curiosity of explorers and historians alike. This box contained a collection of bottles that once fueled the excitement of the park’s visitors—refreshments meant to revive adventurers after thrilling rides and games.\n\nInside that box, there were exactly twenty-four water bottles, each neatly lined up like soldiers ready for duty. However, not all the bottles held water; there was another kind, the treasured apple bottles, which were set apart in number and flavor. These apple bottles outnumbered the water bottles by a count equal to half a dozen more than the amount of water bottles. This meant that for every water bottle, there was a certain number of apple bottles representing a specific surplus.\n\nThe layout of these bottles was more than a simple arrangement—it was a puzzle left behind by the park’s creators. They carefully designed the quantity of each to balance the popularity of the drinks and the logistics of storage. The mystery invites one to uncover the total number of bottles resting silently in that box, combining the familiar clarity of water with the crispness of apple in perfect measure.\n\nTo solve this piece of the theme park’s lost blueprint, one must determine the total number of bottles contained within that mysterious box, accounting for the precise relationship between the water and apple bottles. This requires unraveling the count of the apple bottles based on their described surplus and adding that to the count of water bottles.\n\nWhat, then, is the total sum of bottles lying within this timeworn container, holding tales of refreshment and forgotten celebrations?",
    "answer": "Since a dozen has 12 items, the box has 2 dozen water bottles, a total of 2*12=<<2*12=24>>24 water bottles.\nThe box also has half a dozen more apple bottles than water bottles, meaning there are 1/2*12= 6 more apple bottles than water bottles.\nThe total number of apple bottles in the box is 24+6 = <<24+6=30>>30\nIn the box, there are a total of 30+24 =<<30+24=54>>54 bottles\n#### 54",

    "question": "In the heart of the metropolis, the Citywide Lantern Festival had taken an unexpected turn this year. Instead of the usual throngs of visitors admiring glowing lanterns, the sprawling shopping mall at the city center became overrun by a peculiar and restless group: zombies. By the present day, the mall was teeming with 480 of these eerie figures, shuffled between shops and food courts, illuminated faintly by the festival's soft light.\n\nThe city’s officials, recording the unsettling growth of this undead population, noted a curious pattern. The number of zombies was not static—it had been steadily doubling every day. One morning there were a certain few, but as the sun rose the next day, their ranks mysteriously multiplied twofold, and this phenomenon repeated itself with relentless precision through the days that followed.\n\nAs the festival’s logkeeper documented these happenings, a question arose: if the mall currently held 480 zombies, and this growth pattern had been consistent, how many days ago did the number of zombies fall under a critical threshold of less than 50? This mark was significant, as it was believed that below this number, the mall’s occupants might have been caught and the outbreak contained.\n\nWith each day tracing back in time halving the zombie population, the logbook sought to uncover the exact measure of days that had passed since the mall’s undead populace was fewer than 50. This would pinpoint the moment when the invasion had been on a much smaller scale, offering a glimpse into the early stage of the outbreak.\n\nThe records must be sifted carefully to determine just how many days had elapsed from that safer, quieter time to the present overwhelming number of 480 zombies. Thus, the lantern festival’s chronicles stand ready for calculation: how many days in the past had the mall’s zombie inhabitants been fewer than fifty before their ominous doubling began?",
    "answer": "First find how many zombies there were one day ago: 480 zombies / 2 = <<480/2=240>>240 zombies\nThen find how many zombies there were two days ago: 240 zombies / 2 = <<240/2=120>>120 zombies\nThen find the number of zombies there were three days ago: 120 zombies / 2 = <<120/2=60>>60 zombies\nThen find the number of zombies there were four days ago: 60 zombies / 2 = <<60/2=30>>30 zombies, which is less than 50, so there were less than 50 zombies 4 days ago.\n#### 4",

    "question": "**Alien Zoo Containment Manual**\n\nIn the bustling sector of the Galactic Academy, a specialized unit is responsible for managing the behavioral studies of diverse humanoid specimens classified as “student hybrids.” This unit supervises exactly one hundred such specimens at any given cycle. Among these, the containment protocols distinguish between two primary morphs: those tagged as “Boy” morphs and those tagged as “Girl” morphs, each demonstrating unique social and developmental patterns.\n\nAccording to the most recent biometric scans, the proportion of Boy morphs to Girl morphs across the containment chamber adheres precisely to a ratio of three to two. This implies that for every set of five specimens, three exhibit Boy morph characteristics, while two display Girl morph traits. This balanced ratio governs interaction protocols and resource distribution among the specimens.\n\nThe containment officers now face a critical task: they need to understand the population dynamics within the chamber by determining the numerical difference between the two morph groups. Specifically, the question is how many more Boy morphs exist compared to Girl morphs, given the total count and the established ratio.\n\nAccurate knowledge of this difference is essential for adjusting containment environments and ensuring that social enrichment activities are proportionally tailored. The calculated discrepancy will guide decisions on habitat modifications and psychological stimulation schedules required for optimal specimen well-being.\n\nWith the entire specimen population firmly locked at one hundred and their morph ratio set at three Boy morphs for every two Girl morphs, containment engineers are prepared to analyze and deduce the exact surplus count of Boy morphs. What is this numeric surplus that distinguishes the Boy morph population from their Girl morph counterparts?",

Today, she was preparing for the biggest festival of the season and needed to manage her budget with precision to bring the event’s magic to life.\n\nShelly carried with her a collection of bills to ensure she had enough to cover all expenses. She held exactly ten bills, each valued at ten dollars, neatly organized in one pocket. However, her smaller bills were fewer in number — she counted four less of the five-dollar bills than the ten-dollar ones she carried. This particular blend of currency was crucial, as it dictated how she could allocate funds to artists, food stalls, and performers.\n\nAs an astute event designer, Shelly wanted to understand the full extent of her financial resources. Knowing the exact amount she had—derived from the number of ten-dollar bills and the carefully counted five-dollar bills—was essential to ensure the festival would unfold without a hitch, maintaining the balance between spending and the spectacle she envisioned.\n\nHer task was clear: combine the value of all her ten-dollar bills with that of her five-dollar bills, which were precisely four fewer in count, and determine the total sum she held.

    "question": "In the desolate remains of a once-thriving city, Allen and his mother cling to each other for survival. Age is a precious marker of experience and resilience, and it shapes the fragile hierarchy within their small community of survivors. Allen, though young and determined, carries the wisdom passed down from his mother, who has endured many harsh seasons.\n\nThe years have weighed differently on them both. Allen's age trails behind his mother's, marking a gap of precisely twenty-five years—a testament to the long lineage of hardship she has borne. They often talk about the days to come, eyes fixed on the horizon, pondering their shared future in the unforgiving wasteland.\n\nIn three cycles of the sun, the combined count of seasons they have each weathered will total forty-one. This knowledge gives them a tentative hope, a signpost in time that they measure carefully amid the chaos surrounding them.\n\nTheir survival depends not only on resourcefulness but on understanding the passage of their own lives. To plan for what lies ahead, Allen needs to understand exactly how old his mother is now, in the present moment, beyond the simple gap they know so well.\n\nThe challenge they face is precise: given the current difference in their ages and the sum their ages will reach after three years, what is Allen’s mother’s current age in this harsh post-apocalyptic world?",
    "answer": "In 3 years, the sum of their present ages will be added by 3 (from Allen) + 3 (from her mother) = <<3+3=6>>6.\nSo, the sum of their present ages is 41 - 6 = <<41-6=35>>35.\nLet x be the present age of Allen's mother and x - 25 be the present age of Allen.\nSo the equation using the sum of their present ages is x + x - 25 = 35.\nBy combining like terms, the equation becomes 2x = 60.\nHence, Allen's mother is x = 60/2 = <<60/2=30>>30 years old now.\n#### 30",

    "question": "Long ago, in a realm where heroes proved their worth through trials of wisdom, there lived two brothers born of the same celestial lineage. The younger, known among the villagers as Trevor, aspired to gain the favor of the gods by understanding the passage of time and the bonds of kinship. His elder brother, a warrior of great renown, was revered by all at the age of thirty-two summers.\n\nThe elders told a tale from two decades past, when the elder sibling’s strength and age were twice those of the young Trevor. This truth remained unchallenged through the ages, a riddle for any who sought to grasp the depths of their connection. Now, as the elder stands tall at thirty-two, the years have shifted like the turning of the seasons, and the question arises: what was the age of young Trevor ten years past, in the days when the trials of youth were still fresh upon him?\n\nTo claim his place among the wise, Trevor must unravel this enigma. He must measure the span of years that separate now from then, and from those ancient days when his brother’s years doubled his own. The balance of ages hinges upon this knowledge, whispering secrets through the fabric of time itself.\n\nThe hero’s challenge is set: knowing the brother’s age at this very moment is thirty-two, and that twenty years ago his age was twice that of Trevor’s age back then, what was Trevor’s own age a full ten years ago? By shedding light on this, Trevor will demonstrate his mastery of the silent language of numbers that govern mortal lives.\n\nSo the question lingers in the hall of heroes, waiting for the keen mind to decipher the years passed under the eternal sun and moon.

    "question": "In the sprawling metropolis where temporal shifts happen with alarming frequency, strict protocols govern every aspect of daily life—including recreation. Tobias, a seasoned time traveler, decided to spend an afternoon at the city's renowned aquatic center, where time moves normally despite the chronal flux outside. According to the pool’s regulations, visitors must report their exact duration spent swimming to ensure their chronon energy stays balanced.\n\nTobias plunged into the water, determined to swim continuously for exactly three hours. His rhythm was precise: every one hundred meters covered took him five minutes, a pace he maintained steadily. However, time travel fatigue protocols mandated that for every twenty-five minutes of continuous exertion, a swimmer had to pause for exactly five minutes to recalibrate their temporal senses. These breaks were non-negotiable and factored into the total three-hour allotment he had planned to spend in the water.\n\nThroughout his visit, this cycle of swimming and resting continued without variation. Tobias monitored the clock closely, knowing that the balance between active swimming minutes and mandatory pauses defined how far he could actually travel through the watery lanes. Each span of twenty-five minutes swimming was punctuated with a five-minute respite, and this pattern persisted until the entire three hours had elapsed.\n\nThe aquatic center’s chronotime supervisors were curious to determine Tobias’s total distance in such a regulated environment. Given his steady pace and precise adherence to the mandatory breaks, they sought to calculate the total number of meters he managed to swim during his scheduled visit. This calculation needed to respect the protocol: five minutes to swim each hundred meters, and a compulsory five-minute rest after every twenty-five minutes of continuous swimming.\n\nIn this tightly managed system where time and effort were precisely quantified, knowing Tobias’s total meters traveled would reveal not just his physical endurance, but also how temporal regulations influence even the simplest acts of leisure in a world balancing present and future.\n\nWhat number of meters did Tobias successfully swim during his three-hour stay at the pool, considering both his swimming speed and the enforced rest intervals?",
    "answer": "We need to count the sequences that Tobias made, which consist of 25 minutes of swimming and a 5-minute pause, so one sequence lasts for 25 minutes + 5 minutes = <<25+5=30>>30 minutes/sequence.\nThree hours is 3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes, so he is able to make 180 minutes / 30 minutes/sequence = <<180/30=6>>6 sequences.\nTherefore Tobias needs to make 6 pauses within these 6 sequences, which will last for 6 pauses * 5 minutes/pause = <<6*5=30>>30 minutes.\nDuring three hours, he is going to swim for 180 minutes - 30 minutes = <<180-30=150>>150 minutes.\nTherefore Tobias can make 100 meters for 150 minutes / 5 minutes/100 meters = 3 times.\nSo he was able to swim 30 times * 100 meters/time = <<30*100=3000>>3000 meters in total.\n#### 3000",

Her vision centered on the harmonious coexistence of mystical snakes, which were housed in rare enchanted spheres known as breeding balls. Each breeding ball was a marvel, nurturing a safe community of snakes within its shimmering boundary.\n\nOn this particular night, as Mary traversed the dream world, she came upon three such breeding balls. Each of these spheres held exactly eight slithering serpents, snug and vibrant within their orb-like habitats. Besides these crystalline globes, the dreamscape also contained six distinct pairs of snakes, coiled and rhythmically flicking their tongues beneath the luminescent sky.\n\nMary’s task was to grasp the full scale of the serpents populating her dream vision — the total number of snakes spread both inside the three mystical breeding balls and in the six additional pairs roaming the landscape. To shape the next phase of her creation, she needed to understand this total population precisely.\n\nThe dream’s balance depended on accurate knowledge—each snake was a thread in the intricate web of her design. Wisely, she paused to count every serpent she observed, ensuring her dream maintained its intended rhythm and wonder.\n\nAs she stood contemplating this serpentine tableau, the question arose: What was the entire number of snakes Mary had seen, combining those housed within the three breeding balls and those forming the six separate pairs?",

It wasn’t a treasure chest nor a stolen vault of gold, but something surprisingly mundane—a collection of coins that carried its own cryptic significance. Among the cluttered streets near the old subway station, Tom gathered a handful of shiny quarters, modest dimes, small nickels, and an astonishing number of pennies.\n\nThe discovery was oddly precise. He had exactly ten quarters, each one shimmering like a newly minted emblem of the city’s history. Alongside these were three dimes, their small size belying their value, and four nickels that jingled softly with a subtle weight. But what truly caught Tom’s attention was a neat stack of two hundred pennies—copper-surfaced, yet gleaming with tales untold.\n\nAs an investigator of urban legends, Tom knew that the true story lies in understanding the significance beneath the surface. The coins must be studied, their worth calculated carefully to unveil any hidden meaning or pattern they could reveal about this part of the city.

    "question": "In the grand courtroom of Fruitland, where the laws of produce are upheld with strict logic, a curious case was brought before the judge. The evidence involved four baskets, each carefully inspected and counted by the fruit analysts. These baskets were not ordinary containers—they were key to determining the total treasure of fruits assembled for a festival.\n\nThe prosecution presented the first three baskets as one unit, revealing their contents with precise figures: a total of nine apples, fifteen oranges, and fourteen bananas, all counted meticulously. However, the defense argued that the fourth basket bore a different tally—a lesser bounty by exactly two units for each kind of fruit compared to the combined quantities in the first three. This meant each fruit in the final basket was diminished by two from the numbers found earlier, a point that was undisputed but crucial to the outcome.\n\nAs the court deliberated, it was clear the case hinged on applying this relationship: knowing the grand sum of apples, oranges, and bananas held in the first three baskets, and understanding that the fourth basket contained two fewer of each fruit relative to those totals. The goal was to integrate these figures within the boundaries of the courtroom’s logic system to arrive at an undeniable sum.\n\nThe lead attorney reminded the jury that the fruits, though counted individually, must be combined to understand the full harvest. The challenge was to determine how many fruits there were in total when all four baskets were considered together, matching the criteria of the court’s established facts.\n\nIn this contest of numbers and reasoning, the court awaited the calculation that would reveal the full extent of the fruit bounty, thus putting an end to the dispute with clarity and precision.

    "question": "In the ancient realm of Eldoria, where runes governed the fates of many, there lived a determined woman named Nancy. Long ago, her former ally had vowed to support the child she bore, binding himself by the sacred law that demanded he surrender thirty runes of his annual harvest—measured in shimmering gold coins—to her care. This pact was to be honored every year, a tribute proportional to the wealth he earned through his toil and craft.\n\nFor three full revolutions of the sun, the exiled warrior gathered a steady income of thirty thousand gold coins each year. After this era, a blessing from the Ancients bestowed upon him a rise in fortune—a surge of twenty percent more than his former harvest, which he enjoyed for the subsequent four years. Throughout all these cycles, the law remained clear: three-tenths of his yearly gains must be offered as child support, an unbreakable command inscribed in the tablets of justice.\n\nYet, amidst the unfolding seasons and shifting tides of fortune, Nancy found only twelve hundred gold coins gracing her hands—a meager tribute compared to what was decreed by the runestone contracts. This solitary sum was the total that had arrived from her ex across all years past, a faint echo of the true dues writ in the ancient runes.\n\nThe challenge now lies within the scrolls of Eldoria’s law: to decipher the true amount owed to Nancy according to the sacred rules that bind wealth and obligation. The puzzle seeks to reveal the weight of gold still claimed by law, which must be retrieved to fulfill the pact’s intent in full.\n\nIn the grand halls where elders and sages gather to interpret runes and reckon debts, the question is posed: What is the full sum of gold coins the exiled warrior owes Nancy, once his all payments are accounted for against the sacred thirty percent of his earnings each year, considering his steady income, subsequent rise, and the paltry tribute she has received?",

This colony thrived under the ever-watchful eyes of its Medic Council, who carefully monitored the health of its inhabitants as they adapted to the rigors of off-world life. Joey had recently been prescribed a specialized medication crucial for his recovery from a rare cosmic ailment—a regimen unlike any other in the colony’s medical archives.\n\nThe Medic Council's instructions were precise: on the very first day, Joey was to take a single pill extracted from the bioengineered plants grown in the colony’s hydroponic gardens. But healing in this new world demanded a unique pace—each subsequent day required Joey to increase his intake by exactly two more pills than the day before. This meant that if he took one pill on the first day, then the second day would see him taking a dosage larger by two pills, the third day two pills more than that, and so forth.\n\nJoey found the routine challenging but understood that this daily escalation was designed to steadily boost his resilience against the strange space-borne pathogens common on Novus Prime.

    "question": "In the bustling Genetic Algorithm Lab, Ellianna was running an experiment on nutrient distributions within aquatic creatures. Her focus was on three species: the herring, the eel, and the pike. Each species carried a distinctive amount of fat essential for modeling efficient energy storage in their genetic blueprints.\n\nAccording to the lab’s established data, the herring contained exactly 40 ounces of fat, serving as a high-fat baseline. In contrast, the eel was a leaner specimen with 20 ounces of fat documented in its genome. The pike’s fat content was intriguingly related to the eel’s; it surpassed the eel's fat amount by a precise margin of 10 ounces, embodying an evolutionary adaptation linked to its habitat and hunting style.\n\nEllianna had prepared 40 specimens from each species—40 herrings, 40 eels, and 40 pikes—all cooked uniformly to standardize the fat content readings. Her objective was to assess the total amount of fat consumed when these groups are aggregated, providing insight into dietary fat intake for a hypothetical ecosystem model.\n\nThe challenge lay in quantifying the sum of fat ounces contained in all 120 fish combined, given the specific fat content per fish type and their distinct quantities. This total would feed into her algorithm, calibrating prediction models for resource allocation in future generations.\n\nWhat was the calculated total amount of fat, measured in ounces, that Ellianna served after preparing these 40 individuals from each fish species?",
    "answer": "Ellianna cooking 40 herrings with 40 oz of fat each gives her 40*40 = <<40*40=1600>>1600 oz of fat.\nIf Ellianna also cooked 40 eels with 20 oz of fat each, she got 40*20 = <<40*20=800>>800 0z of fat.\nAll the herrings and eels together have a total fat content of 1600+800 = <<1600+800=2400>>2400 oz of fat.\nA pike, with 10 more oz of fat than an eel, has 10+20 = <<10+20=30>>30 oz of fat\nCooking 40 pikes gives 40*30= <<40*30=1200>>1200 oz of fat.\nSince Ellianna cooked all the fish, she had 1200+2400 = <<1200+2400=3600>>3600 oz of fat in her serving.\n#### 3600",

    "question": "In the midst of a sprawling medieval kingdom, the quartermaster oversaw the supply caravans that provisioned the king’s war effort. Among the stashes of important goods was a collection of tactical manuals—thick leather-bound tomes filled with battle strategies and siegecraft knowledge. These precious manuscripts were purchased by the quartermaster’s merchant at a cost of 50 gold coins each, a significant investment given the kingdom’s strained treasury.\n\nTo recoup expenses and fund further supplies, the merchant priced the manuals above cost, setting each tome’s price 30% higher than what the quartermaster paid. This markup was customary in the bustling market square, where traders sought to maintain healthy reserves for future ventures. However, to attract the interest of commanders and garrisons eager to prepare their troops, the merchant declared a grand sale, offering a 10% price reduction on every manual.\n\nGiven this intricate dance of pricing—first increasing, then discounting—the merchant needed to understand the final profit made from selling each book. Despite the discount, the sale still aimed to bring a gain above the original cost, but the precise advantage remained to be determined.\n\nThe quartermaster, aware of the kingdom’s need for both prudence and profitability, tasked the merchant with calculating the true percentage gain yielded by this pricing strategy. This calculation had to consider the original cost, the markup applied, and the subsequent discount offered during the sale, all within the realm of medieval commerce norms.\n\nWith gold coins at stake and the kingdom’s war preparations hinging upon sound logistics, the merchant sat down to carefully unravel the final outcome. The question now standing before them was this: after pricing the book 30% above its original cost and then applying a 10% discount during the sale, what was the merchant’s actual percentage profit on each tactical manual?",
    "answer": "The store made a $50 x 30/100 = $<<50*30/100=15>>15 profit for selling it 30% above the cost.\nSo, the book was sold for $50 + $15 = $<<50+15=65>>65.\nDuring a sale, the book’s selling price decreased by $65 x 10/100 = $<<65*10/100=6.50>>6.50.\nSo, the book was sold for $65 - $6.50 = $<<65-6.5=58.50>>58.50.\nThere was $58.50 - $50 = $<<58.5-50=8.50>>8.50 profit after the discount.\nTherefore, the percent profit is $8.50/$50 x 100% = <<8.5/50*100=17>>17%.\n#### 17",

    "question": "In the quiet village of Eldoria, nestled between ancient forests and sparkling rivers, stood a humble inn known as The Whispering Oak. The inn was run by two young apprentices, Nacho and Divya, who were not only colleagues but fast friends. Every evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon, the innkeeper would record their ages in the large leather-bound ledger that chronicled the lives of all who worked there, for it was said that knowing the age of the apprentices would unlock secrets of the inn’s magic.\n\nOne crisp autumn night, as golden leaves danced in the wind, the innkeeper penned a curious note in the ledger. He wrote that exactly five years from this very day, Nacho’s age would be three times the age of Divya. The ledger also held a precious detail: Divya was known throughout the village to be just a tender five years old at present, her youthful spirit matched only by her inquisitive mind. The magic of the inn pulsed with the significance of this relationship between their ages, as it was believed the age difference bound the apprentices' destinies.\n\nThe innkeeper often mused about the future, but today his mind was set on the present. He wondered about the combined ages of these two apprentices now, as such a sum might reveal something hidden in the ancient runes inscribed within the walls of the Whispering Oak. This sum would weave together both their current stages in life and offer insight into how their fortunes might grow with the inn’s magic in the years ahead.\n\nIn the twilight-lit common room, patrons whispered of the apprentices’ intertwined fates, intrigued by the riddle that the ledger posed. The question remained like a soft ember waiting to ignite: given the certainty of Divya’s current youth and the prophecy of their future age proportions, what could be the combined number of years that these two young souls have traveled in this world as of today? What number, resting quietly in the ledger, held the key to understanding their shared journey?",
    "answer": "If Divya is currently 5 years old, she will be 5+5 = <<5+5=10>>10 years old in five years.\nSince in 5 years Nacho will be three times older than Divya, he will be 3*10 = <<3*10=30>>30 years older than Divya.\nNacho's total age in five years will be 30+10 = <<30+10=40>>40 years.\nCurrently, Nacho is 40-5 = <<40-5=35>>35 years old.\nThe sum of Divya and Nacho's age now is 35+5 = <<35+5=40>>40 years\n#### 40",

    "question": "In the heart of a grand, enigmatic mansion shrouded in mist, lived Hank, a man of curious habits and secret rhythms. Every morning as dawn barely pierced the heavy curtains, he settled himself with the mansion’s ancient newspaper, devouring its contents for precisely thirty minutes. This ritual was steadfast, repeated five days each week, a quiet puzzle engraved into the fabric of his days.\n\nAs twilight gave way to night, Hank’s routine shifted from the mundane to the literary. In the dim glow of his candlelit study, he immersed himself in the pages of a novel, dedicating exactly one hour each evening to this escape. Once again, this took place five evenings out of every seven, a steady beat in the otherwise mysterious cadence of his life within these walls.\n\nBut the weekends in the mansion were altogether different. On both Saturday and Sunday, time seemed to stretch and warp in a peculiar manner. Hank doubled the amount of time he spent reading on these days—both morning and evening sessions expanded beyond the usual limits he observed during the week. Twice the morning ritual, and twice the nightly novel reading, consumed his hours in a way that any observer would find carefully calculated yet puzzling.\n\nNow, within these walls, an observer stares quietly, piecing together the fragments of Hank’s weekly schedule—seeking to uncover the total minutes he dedicates to reading throughout the span of one entire week. Each moment adds a clue, each reading session a thread in the tapestry of this locked mansion’s mystery.\n\nWhat then, is the grand sum of minutes Hank carves out for his reading pursuits in the course of a full seven-day week?",
    "answer": "He reads 30 minutes in the morning 5 days a week for a total of 30*5 = <<30*5=150>>150 minutes\nHe doubles his reading time on the weekends so 30*2 = <<30*2=60>>60 minutes per day\nHe reads 60 minutes on Saturday and Sunday in the mornings for a total of 60+60 = <<60+60=120>>120 minutes\nHe reads 1 hour in the evenings 5 days a week for a total of 1*5 = <<1*5=5>>5 hours\nHe doubles his reading time on the weekends so 1*2 = <<1*2=2>>2 hours per day\nHe reads 2 hours on Saturday and Sunday in the evenings for a total of 2+2 = <<2+2=4>>4 hours\nHe read 5+4 = 9 hours which, when converted to minutes is 9*60 = 540 minutes\nHe reads 150 minutes in the morning and 120 minutes in the evenings and 540 over the weekend for a total of 150+120+540 = 810 minutes in 1 week\n#### 810",

In this encrypted timeline, an intriguing cipher about age evolution has surfaced. The node of my existence—my current age—is tethered to a cryptic ratio involving the past.\n\nSix cycles of the solar orbit ago, my age was encoded in a numerical state. Current data reveals that my present age is precisely threefold the age stored within that previous timestamp. The system’s equation demands that this multiplicative relationship holds without distortion or offset.\n\nThe challenge: within this clandestine network of temporal variables, deduce the integer value that represents my current state of being. This value must uphold the integrity of the condition that the now is three times the then, exactly six years in the past.\n\nProcessing available intel: the system's constants are six cycles for the temporal gap and a factor of three for the age relation. The task is to extract the current age value satisfying these parameters.\n\nAwaiting decryption and solution extraction—what is the current age locked behind this temporal cipher?",
    "answer": "We know that my age divided by three is equal to my age minus six therefore X/3 = X-6 where X = My age\nThis means that X = 3X - 18 because we can multiply both sides by 3\nThis also means that -2X=-18 because we can subtract 3X from the right side.\nTherefore X = 9 because - 18/-2 = <<-18/-2=9>>9\n#### 9",

    "question": "In the bustling realm of Eldoria, two influential leaders, Tapanga and Corey, held sway over a rare and precious resource known as the Lumicandies—crystals of sweetness that could boost the morale of their people and strengthen alliances. These Lumicandies were treasured across the land, and the balance of their distribution often influenced political power and favor within the kingdom.\n\nAt the latest gathering of the Council of Treaties, it was revealed that between Tapanga and Corey, there existed a total of 66 Lumicandies. Yet, the revelation came with a subtle detail that intrigued the council: Tapanga’s hoard exceeded Corey’s by exactly 8 Lumicandies. This meant that Tapanga held a distinct advantage, possessing more of the sweet crystals that symbolized their political capital.\n\nThe council’s task was to determine the exact number of Lumicandies that Corey controlled. Since the sum of their holdings was known, and the difference in the number of candies each leader held was specified, the members had to carefully analyze these constraints to uncover Corey’s share of the precious resource.\n\nDeciphering this numerical riddle was crucial, as understanding Corey’s exact stockpile would provide insights into the balance of power and allow strategists to forecast potential shifts in alliances and influence between the two leaders.\n\nWith the information at hand—the total Lumicandies shared were sixty-six, and Tapanga’s portion was eight more than Corey’s—the council pondered the question: exactly how many Lumicandies did Corey command in this delicate political landscape?",
    "answer": "Let x = the total number of candies Corey has.\nx + 8 = the total number of candies Tapanga has.\nThe equation for the total number of candies is x + (x + 8) = 66\nCombining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 66\nSubtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 58\nDividing both sides by 2, we get x = <<29=29>>29, so Corey has 29 candies.\n#### 29",

    "question": "In the bustling kingdom of Eldoria, the annual census was not only a record of its people but a vital ledger that told tales of generations. Among the many families noted in the scrolls, the household of Lady Anika and her younger sister Maddie drew particular interest from the royal scribes. At present, Lady Anika is counted at the age of 30 summers, a mature figure in the village who carries the wisdom of her years.\n\nThe ledger further reveals a curious relationship between the sisters: Anika’s age is noted as exactly four-thirds that of her sister Maddie’s current years. This precise ratio is an important mark in the census, as it helps the chroniclers understand family growth and lineage projections. Thus, while Anika’s age is directly given, Maddie’s age is a fraction of Anika’s, entwining their stories in the numerical dance of time.\n\nLooking forward, the scribes are tasked with predicting the family’s age compositions a decade and a half hence—specifically, fifteen years into the future. They are to calculate the average of the ages both sisters will have at that time, using the truths recorded in the current ledger and their knowledge of the passage of years.\n\nThis calculation is not merely academic; it serves to inform the kingdom’s understanding of the evolving demographics and helps allocate future resources for the households faithfully recorded in the census. It is thus imperative the scribes employ accurate reasoning based on the given relationships and ages noted at the beginning of this record.\n\nWith these facts in hand—the current age of Anika at 30 summers, the ratio revealing Maddie’s youth, and the time span of fifteen years before them—the challenge stands clear before the kingdom’s finest record-keepers.\n\nIn the end, what will be the average of Lady Anika’s and Maddie’s ages when the fifteenth year from now arrives, as recorded in the ever-watchful census ledger?",
