    "question": "Mona plays a multiplayer video game on the weekends. She joins groups with four other players to complete objectives in the game. The past weekend, she joined 9 groups. One of the groups included two players she had grouped with before that weekend, and another group included one person she had grouped with before. How many unique players did Mona group with on the video game that weekend?",
    "answer": "Mona joined 9 groups, so she played with 9 * 4 = <<9*4=36>>36 people.\nShe grouped with 2 + 1 = <<2+1=3>>3 people twice.\nThus, she played with 36 - 3 = <<36-3=33>>33 unique players that weekend.\n#### 33"

    "question": "To make a shed in his backyard, Tom needs 1000 bricks. He can buy half of the bricks for 50% off of $.50. The other Half he needs to pay full price. How many dollars does Tom spend?",
    "answer": "Tom can buy 1000/2=<<1000/2=500>>500 for half price.\nHe will spend $.50/2= $<<.50/2=.25>>.25 on the half-priced bricks.\nThus, he will spend 500*$.25=$<<500*.25=125>>125 on the half-priced bricks.\nHe will spend 500*$.50=$<<500*.50=250>>250 on the full-priced bricks.\nThus, he will spend $125+$250=$<<125+250=375>>375 total.\n#### 375"

    "question": "Tony has a bucket that holds 2 pounds of sand. He has a sandbox out back that is two feet deep, four feet wide, and 5 feet long. A cubic foot of sand weighs 3 pounds.

How much change will he have after he buys all the water he needs?",
    "answer": "The sandbox is 40 cubic feet because 2 x 4 x 5 = <<2*4*5=40>>40\nHe needs 120 pounds of sand because 40 x 3 = <<40*3=120>>120\nHe will take 60 trips because 120 / 2 = <<120/2=60>>60\nHe will need to drink water 15 times because 60 / 4 = <<60/4=15>>15\nHe will drink 45 ounces of water because 15 x 3 = <<15*3=45>>45\nHe will need 3 bottles of water because 45 / 15 = <<45/15=3>>3\nHe will spend $6 on water because 3 x 2 = <<3*2=6>>6\nHe will have $4 in change because 10 - 6 = <<10-6=4>>4\n#### 4"
