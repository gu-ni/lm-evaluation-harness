    "answer": "If Terrence earns 30 dollars, then Jermaine earns $30 + $5 = $<<30+5=35>>35 dollars.\nThe total earnings of the two are $30 + $35 = $<<30+35=65>>65 dollars.\nEmilee earns $90 - $65 = $<<90-65=25>>25 dollars.\n#### 25"

    "question": "We harvested 405 kg of apples. 90 kg were used to make fruit juice and 60 kg were given to a restaurant. The rest was sold in 5 kg bags and their sale brought in $408. What was the selling price of one bag of apples?",
    "answer": "The weight of apples used for juice and given to the restaurant is 60 + 90 = <<60+90=150>>150 kg\nThus 405 – 150 = 255kg worth of apples were sold in 5 kg bags.\nThere were 255 / 5 = <<255/5=51>>51 bags sold.\nSo each bag was sold for 408 / 51 = $<<408/51=8>>8\n#### 8"

    "question": "Sarah interviewed 450 students at her school and asked them which fruit they liked best - oranges, apples, pears or strawberries. 70 students said they liked oranges, 120 students said they liked pears, and 147 students said they liked apples. How many students picked strawberries as their favorite fruit from the list?",
    "answer": "First, you have to add the number of students that liked the three other fruits. Therefore, you have to add 70 + 120 + 147. This gives you a sum of 337.\nWe know that 450 students were interviewed, so you have to subtract 337 from 450 to get the number of students who liked strawberries. 450 - 337 = <<450-337=113>>113 students liked strawberries best out of all of the fruits.\n#### 113"
