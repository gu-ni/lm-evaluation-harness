    "question": "Today at school, Tina was chatting with her friends about her part-time job at the local bookstore. She earnestly told them how proud she was to make $18.00 every hour she works. It was a steady wage, and it helped her save up for her college fund. But what made her job even more interesting was the extra pay she could receive if she stayed at work beyond her usual eight hours.\n\nIn Tina’s workplace, there was a clear understanding among all the employees: if anyone worked extra hours past the standard eight in one shift, they would earn overtime pay. This wasn’t just a little extra—overtime was rewarding, paid at one and a half times the regular hourly rate. This meant for every hour beyond eight, Tina got her hourly wage plus half of that again for her efforts. It was a way to appreciate those who put in the longer hours without complaint.\n\nThat week, Tina decided to take on a more significant challenge. She committed herself to working ten hours every day, Monday to Friday. Every day, she put in those full ten hours, pushing through the fatigue because she knew those extra hours meant extra money. Her friends were curious how much she could actually earn with this schedule and the overtime policy in place at the bookstore.\n\nTina’s schedule was consistent: ten hours each day, five days a week. Since the additional two hours each day qualified for overtime pay, they wanted to figure out how much her paycheck would be at the end of that busy week. Calculating this was not just about addition and multiplication; it was about understanding how the wage rules affected total earnings over multiple days.\n\nThe question on everyone’s lips was straightforward but important: with her regular hourly wage of $18.00, and the overtime pay set at one and a half times this rate for any hours worked beyond eight in a day, how much money would Tina take home after working her ten-hour days for those five full days? This was the puzzle to solve—a real-life math problem in Tina’s school diary.",
    "answer": "She works 8 hours a day for $18 per hour so she makes 8*18 = $<<8*18=144.00>>144.00 per 8-hour shift\nShe works 10 hours a day and anything over 8 hours is eligible for overtime, so she gets 10-8 = <<10-8=2>>2 hours of overtime\nOvertime is calculated as time and a half so and she makes $18/hour so her overtime pay is 18*.5 = $<<18*.5=9.00>>9.00\nHer overtime pay is 18+9 = $<<18+9=27.00>>27.00\nHer base pay is $144.00 per 8-hour shift and she works 5 days and makes 5 * $144 = $<<144*5=720.00>>720.00\nHer overtime pay is $27.00 per hour and she works 2 hours of overtime per day and makes 27*2 = $<<27*2=54.00>>54.00 in overtime pay\n2 hours of overtime pay for 5 days means she makes 54*5 = $270.00\nIn 5 days her base pay is $720.00 and she makes $270.00 in overtime pay so she makes $720 + $270 = $<<720+270=990.00>>990.00\n#### 990",

    "question": "**Post-Apocalyptic Survival Log**\n\nAfter the world as we knew it fell into ruin, small pockets of humanity began to cling to shards of normalcy. In the heart of what remains of the city, a rare and precious event was set to take place—a gathering known as the Harmony Festival. Securing entry to this event was no trivial matter. Each pass, etched onto a scrap of salvaged metal, was valued at 40 credits, a significant expenditure in this harsh new economy.\n\nOne survivor, a resourceful figure known to the community as Mr. Benson, needed to procure a dozen of these passes. According to the current barter code cut into the ruins of the old commerce system, a subtle yet beneficial convention existed to encourage bulk purchases: for every ticket beyond the tenth acquired in one transaction, a 5% discount was granted on that particular ticket’s price. This meant that the first ten passes would be at full value, while the last two came with a small reprieve from the usual cost.\n\nMr. Benson, aware of this arrangement, carefully counted the credits required before the transaction. With the price and discount structure clearly etched on the decrepit chalkboard at the trading post, he calculated the total sum of credits due. The system’s logic was clear—each pass beyond the tenth was cheaper by a fraction, but the earlier ones held firm at the base rate.\n\nIn this scavenger’s world, where every credit mattered and resources were scarce, understanding exactly how much he would need to surrender was crucial. The gentle discount for the last two tickets was like a rare boon, easing the burden ever so slightly amid scarcity.\n\nWhat remains to be determined is the total amount of credits Mr. Benson paid for all twelve passes combined, considering the fixed ticket price and the discount applied only to those tickets exceeding ten.",
    "answer": "Mr. Benson had a 5% discount for each of the 12 - 10 = <<12-10=2>>2 tickets.\nSo, those two tickets had a $40 x 5/100 = $<<40*5/100=2>>2 discount each.\nHence, each ticket cost $40 - $2 = $<<40-2=38>>38 each.\nThus, two discounted tickets amount to $38 x 2 = $<<38*2=76>>76.\nAnd the other ten tickets amount to $40 x 10 = $<<40*10=400>>400.\nHence, Mr. Benson paid a total of $400 + $76 = $<<400+76=476>>476.\n#### 476",
