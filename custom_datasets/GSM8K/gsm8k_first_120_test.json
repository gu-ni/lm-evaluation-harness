    "question": "A craft store makes a third of its sales in the fabric section, a quarter of its sales in the jewelry section, and the rest in the stationery section. They made 36 sales today. How many sales were in the stationery section?",
    "answer": "The craft store made 36 / 3 = <<36/3=12>>12 sales in the fabric section.\nIt made 36 / 4 = <<36/4=9>>9 sales in the jewelry section.\nThus, there were 36 - 12 - 9 = <<36-12-9=15>>15 sales in the stationery section.\n#### 15"

    "question": "Marcy is a makeup artist and has agreed to do some makeup for her friend's wedding. The only makeup she has limited stock of is lip gloss so she counts how many tubes she needs. Each tube of lip gloss will hold enough lip gloss for 3 people's makeup. Marcy decides to bring 6 tubs of lip gloss, each of which holds 2 tubes of lip gloss, and this will be the exact amount she needs for everyone's makeup. How many people is Marcy painting with makeup?",
    "answer": "Marcy is bringing 6 tubs of lip gloss * 2 tubes of lip gloss per tub of lip gloss = <<6*2=12>>12 tubes of lip gloss.\nSo she must be applying makeup to 12 tubes of lip gloss * 3 people per tube of lip gloss = <<12*3=36>>36 people.\n#### 36"

    "answer": "Ellie needs 2 wheels * 10ml of oil per wheel = <<2*10=20>>20ml of oil.\nTo fix the rest of the bike as well, she needs 20 + 5 = <<20+5=25>>25ml of oil.\n#### 25"

    "question": "Janice can type 6 sentences per minute. Today at work, Janice continued working on a paper she started typing yesterday. She typed for 20 minutes, took a break, and typed 15 minutes longer. She then had to erase 40 sentences she had typed incorrectly. After a meeting, she typed for 18 minutes more. In all, the paper had 536 sentences by the end of today. How many sentences did she start with today?",
    "answer": "Janice had X sentences from yesterday already typed to start with today.\nJanice typed 6 * 20 = <<6*20=120>>120 sentences before her break.\nShe typed 6 * 15 = <<6*15=90>>90 sentences after her break.\nShe typed 6 * 18 = <<6*18=108>>108 sentences after her meeting.\nTherefore, she typed 120 + 90 + 108 = <<120+90+108=318>>318 sentences today in all.\nShe had to erase 40 sentences, so she had 318 - 40 = <<318-40=278>>278 sentences that she typed today left.\nThe paper had X + 278 = 536 sentences at the end of today.\nThus, she had X = 536 - 278 = <<536-278=258>>258 sentences typed on the paper to start with today.\n#### 258"
